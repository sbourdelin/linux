perf-help(1)
============

NAME
----
perf-help - display help information about perf

SYNOPSIS
--------
'perf help' [--all] [--man|--web|--info] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the 'perf'
command and a list of the most commonly used perf commands are printed
on the standard output.

If the option '--all' or '-a' is given, then all available commands are
printed on the standard output.

If a perf command is named, a manual page for that command is brought
up. The 'man' program is used by default for this purpose, but this
can be overridden by other options or configuration variables.

Note that `perf --help ...` is identical to `perf help ...` because the
former is internally converted into the latter.
