	  This selects Yama, which extends DAC support with additional
	  system-wide security settings beyond regular Linux discretionary
	  access controls. Currently available are ptrace scope restriction and
	  enforcement of the O_MAYEXEC open flag.
	  Like capabilities, this security module stacks with other LSMs.
	  Further information can be found in
	  Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.rst.
