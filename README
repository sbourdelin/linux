Linux kernel
============

Linux is a computer operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds
in September of 1991. It runs on a wide variety of hardware architectures and
has all expected features like multitasking, memory management, multistack
networking and so on.

Device drivers are an integral part too, supporting the use of countless
devices. Documentation/process/howto.rst describes how to include a new one.

Documentation
-------------

Linux is documented in the Documentation/ subdirectory. Several of the text
files use the Restructured Text markup notation.

Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst may be what you are looking for and
Documentation/00-INDEX has a list of what is contained in each file.

The included guides for kernel developers and users can be rendered in a number
of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or ``make pdfdocs``.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
