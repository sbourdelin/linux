	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU.  If
	  you say N here, the kernel will run on single and

	  multiprocessor machine. If you say Y here, the kernel will run
	  on many, but not all, single processor machines. On a single
	  processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say N
	  here.

config ISA_C
	bool "Emit compressed instructions when building Linux"
	default n
	help
	   Adds "C" to the ISA subsets that the toolchain is allowed to emit
	   when building Linux, which results in compressed instructions in the
	   Linux binary.

	   If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config ISA_A
	bool "Emit atomic instructions when building Linux"
	default y
	help
	   Adds "A" to the ISA subsets that the toolchain is allowed to emit
	   when building Linux, which results in atomic instructions in the
	   Linux binary.

	   If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config SYSRISCV_ATOMIC
	bool "Include support for atomic operation syscalls"
	default !ISA_A
	help
	  If atomic memory instructions are present, i.e.,
	  CONFIG_ISA_A, this includes support for the syscall that
	  provides atomic accesses.  This is only useful to run
	  binaries that require atomic access but were compiled with
	  -mno-atomic.

config RV_PUM

	  Protect User Memory (PUM) prevents the kernel from inadvertently
	  accessing user-space memory.  There is a small performance cost
	  and kernel size increase if this is enabled.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	default n
	help
	  For most platforms, it is firmware or second stage bootloader
	  that by default specifies the kernel command line options.
	  However, it might be necessary or advantageous to either override
	  the default kernel command line or add a few extra options to it.
	  For such cases, this option allows hardcoding command line options
	  directly into the kernel.

	  For that, choose 'Y' here and fill in the extra boot parameters
	  in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  The built-in options will be concatenated to the default command
	  line if CMDLINE_OVERRIDE is set to 'N'. Otherwise, the default
	  command line will be ignored and replaced by the built-in string.

config CMDLINE

	help
	  Supply command-line options at build time by entering them here.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides bootloader arguments"
	default n
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	help
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the kernel ignore the bootloader
	  or firmware command line.  Instead, the built-in command line
	  will be used exclusively.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables special console drivers which allow the kernel
	  to print messages very early in the bootup process.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.
