config ZINC_SELFTEST
	bool "Zinc cryptography library self-tests"
	help
	  This builds a series of self-tests for the Zinc crypto library, which
	  help diagnose any cryptographic algorithm implementation issues that
	  might be at the root cause of potential bugs. It also adds various
	  traps for incorrect usage.

	  Unless you are optimizing for machines without much disk space or for
	  very slow machines, it is probably a good idea to say Y here, so that
	  any potential cryptographic bugs translate into easy bug reports
	  rather than long-lasting security issues.

config ZINC_DEBUG
	bool "Zinc cryptography library debugging"
	help
	  This turns on a series of additional checks and debugging options
	  that are useful for developers but probably will not provide much
	  benefit to end users.

	  Most people should say N here.
