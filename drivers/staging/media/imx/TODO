- Finish v4l2-compliance

- imx-csi subdev is not being autoloaded as a kernel module, probably
  because ipu_add_client_devices() does not register the IPU client
  platform devices, but only allocates those devices.

- Currently registering with notifications from subdevs are only
  available through the subdev device nodes and not through the main
  capture device node. Need to come up with a way to find the capture
  device in the current pipeline that owns the subdev that sent the
  notify.

- Clean up and move the ov5642 subdev driver to drivers/media/i2c, and
  create the binding docs for it.

- The Frame Interval Monitor could be exported to v4l2-core for
  general use.

- The subdev that is the original source of video data (referred to as
  the "sensor" in the code), is called from various subdevs in the
  pipeline in order to set/query the video standard ({g|s|enum}_std)
  and to get/set the original frame interval from the capture interface
  ([gs]_parm). Instead, the entities that need this info should call its
  direct neighbor, and the neighbor should propagate the call to its
  neighbor in turn if necessary.

- At driver load time, the device-tree node that is the original source
  (the "sensor"), is parsed to record its media bus configuration, and
  this info is required in various subdevs to setup the pipeline.
  Laurent Pinchart argues that instead the subdev should call its
  neighbor's g_mbus_config op (which should be propagated if necessary)
  to get this info. However Hans Verkuil is planning to remove the
  g_mbus_config op. For now this driver uses the parsed DT mbus config
  method until this issue is resolved.
