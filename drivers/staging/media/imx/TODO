- Finish v4l2-compliance

- Clean up and move the ov5642 subdev driver to drivers/media/i2c, and
  create the binding docs for it.

- The Frame Interval Monitor could be exported to v4l2-core for
  general use.

- At driver load time, the device-tree node that is the original source
  (the "sensor"), is parsed to record its media bus configuration, and
  this info is required in imx-media-csi.c to setup the CSI.
  Laurent Pinchart argues that instead the CSI subdev should call its
  neighbor's g_mbus_config op (which should be propagated if necessary)
  to get this info. However Hans Verkuil is planning to remove the
  g_mbus_config op. For now this driver uses the parsed DT mbus config
  method until this issue is resolved.
