This driver is in staging until the V4L controls stabilize.

Given the V4L controls are part of the uABI, it's better
to have the driver in staging, so users are aware of this
driver having an unstable interface.

Having proper userspace support for drivers like this that
use JPEG_RAW and similar formats is also a requirement
for moving out of staging.
