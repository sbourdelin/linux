* Fix checkpatch.pl complaints
* Investigate if V4L2/Media framework can be used on top of HW Layer instead
  of exisiting char driver.
* Possible remaining coding style fix.
* Add support for DMABUF.
* This is an early prototype, hardware register map changes are expected.
* Update driver for 64-bit DMA address once the new Xilinx M2M Scaler IP
  has support for 64-bit DMA Addresses. Current IP supports 32-bit DMA addresses.
* Remove deadcode.
* Add documents in Documentation beyond the DT binding doc.
* This needs a home  in the proper drivers area (example : drivers/misc/),
  once the quality of the driver is improved. Suggestions about where
  it should be placed are welcome.
* The IOCTL header could be moved to an uapi/* area once this is out of staging.
