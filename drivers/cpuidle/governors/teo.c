 * Timer events oriented CPU idle governor
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2018 Intel Corporation
 * Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>
 *
 * The idea of this governor is based on the observation that on many systems
 * timer events are two or more orders of magnitude more frequent than any
 * other interrupts, so they are likely to be the most significant source of CPU
 * wakeups from idle states.  Moreover, information about what happened in the
 * (relatively recent) past can be used to estimate whether or not the deepest
 * idle state with target residency within the time to the closest timer is
 * likely to be suitable for the upcoming idle time of the CPU and, if not, then
 * which of the shallower idle states to choose.
 *
 * Of course, non-timer wakeup sources are more important in some use cases and
 * they can be covered by detecting patterns among recent idle time intervals
 * of the CPU.  However, even in that case it is not necessary to take idle
 * duration values greater than the time till the closest timer into account, as
 * the patterns that they may belong to produce average values close enough to
 * the time till the closest timer (sleep length) anyway.
 *
 * Thus this governor estimates whether or not the upcoming idle time of the CPU
 * is likely to be significantly shorter than the sleep length and selects an
 * idle state for it in accordance with that, as follows:
 *
 * - If there is a pattern of 5 or more recent non-timer wakeups earlier than
 *   the closest timer event, expect one more of them to occur and use the
 *   average of the idle duration values corresponding to them to select an
 *   idle state for the CPU.
 *
 * - Otherwise, find the state on the basis of the sleep length and state
 *   statistics collected over time:
 *
 *   o Find the deepest idle state whose target residency is less than or euqal
 *     to the sleep length.
 *
 *   o Select it if it matched both the sleep length and the idle duration
 *     measured after wakeup in the past more often than it matched the sleep
 *     length, but not the idle duration (i.e. the measured idle duration was
 *     significantly shorter than the sleep length matched by that state).
 *
 *   o Otherwise, select the shallower state with the greatest matched "early"
 *     wakeups metric.
