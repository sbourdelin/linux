 * (now, with legal B.S. out of the way.....)
 *
 * This routine gathers environmental noise from device drivers, etc.,
 * and returns good random numbers, suitable for cryptographic use.
 * Besides the obvious cryptographic uses, these numbers are also good
 * for seeding TCP sequence numbers, and other places where it is
 * desirable to have numbers which are not only random, but hard to
 * predict by an attacker.
 *
 * Theory of operation
 * ===================
 *
 * Computers are very predictable devices.  Hence it is extremely hard
 * to produce truly random numbers on a computer --- as opposed to
 * pseudo-random numbers, which can easily generated by using a
 * algorithm.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for attackers to guess
 * the sequence of pseudo-random number generators, and for some
 * applications this is not acceptable.  So instead, we must try to
 * gather "environmental noise" from the computer's environment, which
 * must be hard for outside attackers to observe, and use that to
 * generate random numbers.  In a Unix environment, this is best done
 * from inside the kernel.
 *
 * Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard
 * timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other
 * events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an
 * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources are
 * added to an "entropy pool", which is mixed using a CRC-like function.
 * This is not cryptographically strong, but it is adequate assuming
 * the randomness is not chosen maliciously, and it is fast enough that
 * the overhead of doing it on every interrupt is very reasonable.
 * As random bytes are mixed into the entropy pool, the routines keep
 * an *estimate* of how many bits of randomness have been stored into
 * the random number generator's internal state.
 *
 * When random bytes are desired, they are obtained by taking the SHA
 * hash of the contents of the "entropy pool".  The SHA hash avoids
 * exposing the internal state of the entropy pool.  It is believed to
 * be computationally infeasible to derive any useful information
 * about the input of SHA from its output.  Even if it is possible to
 * analyze SHA in some clever way, as long as the amount of data
 * returned from the generator is less than the inherent entropy in
 * the pool, the output data is totally unpredictable.  For this
 * reason, the routine decreases its internal estimate of how many
 * bits of "true randomness" are contained in the entropy pool as it
 * outputs random numbers.
 *
 * If this estimate goes to zero, the routine can still generate
 * random numbers; however, an attacker may (at least in theory) be
 * able to infer the future output of the generator from prior
 * outputs.  This requires successful cryptanalysis of SHA, which is
 * not believed to be feasible, but there is a remote possibility.
 * Nonetheless, these numbers should be useful for the vast majority
 * of purposes.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- output
 * ===============================
 *
 * There are three exported interfaces; the first is one designed to
 * be used from within the kernel:
 *
 * 	void get_random_bytes(void *buf, int nbytes);
 *
 * This interface will return the requested number of random bytes,
 * and place it in the requested buffer.
 *
 * The two other interfaces are two character devices /dev/random and
 * /dev/urandom.  /dev/random is suitable for use when very high
 * quality randomness is desired (for example, for key generation or
 * one-time pads), as it will only return a maximum of the number of
 * bits of randomness (as estimated by the random number generator)
 * contained in the entropy pool.
 *
 * The /dev/urandom device does not have this limit, and will return
 * as many bytes as are requested.  As more and more random bytes are
 * requested without giving time for the entropy pool to recharge,
 * this will result in random numbers that are merely cryptographically
 * strong.  For many applications, however, this is acceptable.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- input
 * ==============================
 *
 * The current exported interfaces for gathering environmental noise
 * from the devices are:
 *
 *	void add_device_randomness(const void *buf, unsigned int size);
 * 	void add_input_randomness(unsigned int type, unsigned int code,
 *                                unsigned int value);
 *	void add_interrupt_randomness(int irq, int irq_flags);
 * 	void add_disk_randomness(struct gendisk *disk);
 *
 * add_device_randomness() is for adding data to the random pool that
 * is likely to differ between two devices (or possibly even per boot).
 * This would be things like MAC addresses or serial numbers, or the
 * read-out of the RTC. This does *not* add any actual entropy to the
 * pool, but it initializes the pool to different values for devices
 * that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy
 * available to them (particularly common in the embedded world).
 *
 * add_input_randomness() uses the input layer interrupt timing, as well as
 * the event type information from the hardware.
 *
 * add_interrupt_randomness() uses the interrupt timing as random
 * inputs to the entropy pool. Using the cycle counters and the irq source
 * as inputs, it feeds the randomness roughly once a second.
 *
 * add_disk_randomness() uses what amounts to the seek time of block
 * layer request events, on a per-disk_devt basis, as input to the
 * entropy pool. Note that high-speed solid state drives with very low
 * seek times do not make for good sources of entropy, as their seek
 * times are usually fairly consistent.
 *
 * All of these routines try to estimate how many bits of randomness a
 * particular randomness source.  They do this by keeping track of the
 * first and second order deltas of the event timings.
 *
 * Ensuring unpredictability at system startup
 * ============================================
 *
 * When any operating system starts up, it will go through a sequence
 * of actions that are fairly predictable by an adversary, especially
 * if the start-up does not involve interaction with a human operator.
 * This reduces the actual number of bits of unpredictability in the
 * entropy pool below the value in entropy_count.  In order to
 * counteract this effect, it helps to carry information in the
 * entropy pool across shut-downs and start-ups.  To do this, put the
 * following lines an appropriate script which is run during the boot
 * sequence:
 *
 *	echo "Initializing random number generator..."
 *	random_seed=/var/run/random-seed
 *	# Carry a random seed from start-up to start-up
 *	# Load and then save the whole entropy pool
 *	if [ -f $random_seed ]; then
 *		cat $random_seed >/dev/urandom
 *	else
 *		touch $random_seed
 *	fi
 *	chmod 600 $random_seed
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=512
 *
 * and the following lines in an appropriate script which is run as
 * the system is shutdown:
 *
 *	# Carry a random seed from shut-down to start-up
 *	# Save the whole entropy pool
 *	echo "Saving random seed..."
 *	random_seed=/var/run/random-seed
 *	touch $random_seed
 *	chmod 600 $random_seed
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=512
 *
 * For example, on most modern systems using the System V init
 * scripts, such code fragments would be found in
 * /etc/rc.d/init.d/random.  On older Linux systems, the correct script
 * location might be in /etc/rcb.d/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.0.
 *
 * Effectively, these commands cause the contents of the entropy pool
 * to be saved at shut-down time and reloaded into the entropy pool at
 * start-up.  (The 'dd' in the addition to the bootup script is to
 * make sure that /etc/random-seed is different for every start-up,
 * even if the system crashes without executing rc.0.)  Even with
 * complete knowledge of the start-up activities, predicting the state
 * of the entropy pool requires knowledge of the previous history of
 * the system.
 *
 * Configuring the /dev/random driver under Linux
 * ==============================================
 *
 * The /dev/random driver under Linux uses minor numbers 8 and 9 of
 * the /dev/mem major number (#1).  So if your system does not have
 * /dev/random and /dev/urandom created already, they can be created
 * by using the commands:
 *
 * 	mknod /dev/random c 1 8
 * 	mknod /dev/urandom c 1 9
 *
 * Acknowledgements:
 * =================
 *
 * Ideas for constructing this random number generator were derived
 * from Pretty Good Privacy's random number generator, and from private
 * discussions with Phil Karn.  Colin Plumb provided a faster random
 * number generator, which speed up the mixing function of the entropy
 * pool, taken from PGPfone.  Dale Worley has also contributed many
 * useful ideas and suggestions to improve this driver.
 *
 * Any flaws in the design are solely my responsibility, and should
 * not be attributed to the Phil, Colin, or any of authors of PGP.
 *
 * Further background information on this topic may be obtained from
 * RFC 4086, "Randomness Requirements for Security", by Donald
 * Eastlake, Steve Crocker, and Jeff Schiller.

 * Originally, we used a primitive polynomial of degree .poolwords
 * over GF(2).  The taps for various sizes are defined below.  They
 * were chosen to be evenly spaced except for the last tap, which is 1
 * to get the twisting happening as fast as possible.
 *
 * For the purposes of better mixing, we use the CRC-32 polynomial as
 * well to make a (modified) twisted Generalized Feedback Shift
 * Register.  (See M. Matsumoto & Y. Kurita, 1992.  Twisted GFSR
 * generators.  ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation
 * 2(3):179-194.  Also see M. Matsumoto & Y. Kurita, 1994.  Twisted
 * GFSR generators II.  ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer
 * Simulation 4:254-266)
 *
 * Thanks to Colin Plumb for suggesting this.
 *
 * The mixing operation is much less sensitive than the output hash,
 * where we use SHA-1.  All that we want of mixing operation is that
 * it be a good non-cryptographic hash; i.e. it not produce collisions
 * when fed "random" data of the sort we expect to see.  As long as
 * the pool state differs for different inputs, we have preserved the
 * input entropy and done a good job.  The fact that an intelligent
 * attacker can construct inputs that will produce controlled
 * alterations to the pool's state is not important because we don't
 * consider such inputs to contribute any randomness.  The only
 * property we need with respect to them is that the attacker can't
 * increase his/her knowledge of the pool's state.  Since all
 * additions are reversible (knowing the final state and the input,
 * you can reconstruct the initial state), if an attacker has any
 * uncertainty about the initial state, he/she can only shuffle that
 * uncertainty about, but never cause any collisions (which would
 * decrease the uncertainty).
 *
 * Our mixing functions were analyzed by Lacharme, Roeck, Strubel, and
 * Videau in their paper, "The Linux Pseudorandom Number Generator
 * Revisited" (see: http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/251.pdf).  In their
 * paper, they point out that we are not using a true Twisted GFSR,
 * since Matsumoto & Kurita used a trinomial feedback polynomial (that
 * is, with only three taps, instead of the six that we are using).
 * As a result, the resulting polynomial is neither primitive nor
 * irreducible, and hence does not have a maximal period over
 * GF(2**32).  They suggest a slight change to the generator
 * polynomial which improves the resulting TGFSR polynomial to be
 * irreducible, which we have made here.

 * Experimental code to replace parts of random.c
 * Everything from here down is new code.
 * Sandy Harris, sandyinchina@gmail.com
 *
 * Uses 128-bit hash from AES-GCM instead of 160-bit
 * SHA-1. Changing the hash also allows other changes.
 *
 * Goals:
 *
 * The main design goal was improved decoupling so that
 * heavy use of /dev/urandom does not deplete the entropy
 * pool for /dev/random. As I see it, this is the only
 * place where the current random(4) design is visibly
 * flawed.
 *
 * Another goal was simpler mixing in of additional data
 * in various places. This may help with the difficult
 * problem of timely initialisation; there have been
 * some security failures due to mis-handling of this
 * issue. These cannot be completely dealt with in the
 * driver, but we can do some things.
 *
 * I believe this code achieves both goals.
 *
 * The GCM hash:
 *
 * This sort of hash-like primitive has largely replaced
 * more complex hashes in IPsec and TLS authentication;
 * the new methods are often considerably faster and the
 * code is simpler. It therefore seemed worth trying such
 * a hash here.
 *
 * I chose the Galois field multiplication from AES-GCM
 * because it is widely used, well-analysed, and
 * considered secure. References are RFCs 4106 and 5288
 * and NIST standard SP-800-38D.
 *
 * Intel and AMD both have instructions designed to
 * make the GCM calculation faster
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLMUL_instruction_set
 * Those are not used in this proof-of-concept code
 *
 * https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/157.pdf discusses bugs
 * in the Open SSL version of this hash.
 *
 * Whether GCM is secure for this application needs
 * analysis. IPsec generates a 128-bit hash but uses
 * only 96 bits, which makes some attacks much harder;
 * this application uses all 128 bits. Also, the input
 * for IPsec authentication is ciphertext, which is
 * highly random with any decent cipher; input here is
 * mainly pool data which may be much less random.
 *
 * Existing random(4) code folds the 160-bit SHA-1
 * output to get an 80-bit final output; I do not
 * consider such a transform necessary here, but that
 * needs analysis too.
 *	
 * I add complications beyond the basic hash; those need
 * analysis as well.
 *
 * Differences from current driver:
 *
 * I change nothing on the input side; the whole entropy
 * collection and estimation part of existing code, as
 * applied to the input pool, are untouched.
 *
 * The hashing and output routines, though, are completely
 * replaced. The management of output pools is also changed;
 * they just count how many outputs since the last reseed,
 * as a counter-mode block cipher does, rather than trying
 * to track entropy.
 *
 * Mixing:
 *
 * Much of the mixing uses invertible functions such
 * as the pseudo-Hadamard transform or aria_mix().
 * These provably cannot reduce entropy; if they
 * did, it would not be possible to invert them.
 *
 * As in existing code, all operations putting data
 * into any pool are unidirectional; they use += or
 * ^= to mix in new data so they cannot reduce the
 * randomness of the pool, even with bad input data.
 *
 * I add an array of constants[], two for each pool,
 * for use in the hashing, and a counter[] used
 * in every output operation. All operations that
 * put new data into those are also unidirectional.
 *
 * Output dependencies
 *
 * Every output from a normal pool (input, blocking
 * or non-blocking) involves a GCM hash of pool
 * contents.
 *
 * As well as pool data, every output depends on:
 *
 *   two-128-bit entries from constants[] used
 *      in the hashing
 *   a global counter[] which is also hashed
 *
 * There is a 4th dummy pool (pool == NULL)
 * which only hashes the counter, intended to
 * replace the MD5 code in the current driver.
 *
 * There are three functions to get 128 bits,
 * two from a specified pool p
 *
 *	get128( p, out )      may block
 *	get_or_fail( p, out ) non-blocking
 *
 * get_any( out ) tries a series of sources,
 * never blocks but does not always give a
 * high-grade result
 *
 * Tests:
 *
 * Various tests here are deliberately more general
 * than necessary; this protects against coding
 * blunders, against flukes like a cosmic ray changing
 * memory, and against misbehaviour from stressed devices
 * like an overheated router, whether the stress is just
 * natural or is part of an attack.
 *
 * For example, when a value is confidently expected
 * to be either 0 or 1, if(x==0) ... if(x==1) ...
 * is the obvious way to test it, but it is slightly
 * safer to use if(x==0) ... else ... so unexpected
 * cases can be handled. Similarly, end-of-loop tests
 * could use x == N but x >= N is slightly safer.
 *
 * The value of this is arguably negligible and certainly
 * minor, but the cost is near-zero and the behaviour
 * is identical in all expected cases. I have therefore
 * done this everywhere that I noticed it was possible.
 * It would also be possible, of course, to detect and
 * log unexpected cases, but it is not clear that this
 * would be of much value.

 *
 * The Cubehash algorithm has three stages:
 *
 *    1 put some constants into the array
 *      mix with this transform to get initial state
 *    2 for each input block
 *        mix input into state

 * Input pool rekeys from external data and maybe hardware rng
 * Blocking pool rekeys from the input pool before every output
 * Dummy pool gets its constants changed when top_mix() is used.
 *
 * In mix_first() all pools sometimes mix their own constants
 * and in mix_last() all non-dummy pools get feedback applied
 * to their pool data. All pools are affected by the counter[]
 * and by mix_const_all().
 *
 * The only place where rekeying needs more complex management
 * is for the nonblocking pool
 *
 * The blocking pool generates only one /dev/random output
 * each time it is reseeded. It appears safe to generate
 * additional outputs to reseed the nonblocking pool; there is
 * good mixing there so blocking pool output is not exposed to
 * attack by this, except in a remarkably indirect way.
 *
 * The blocking pool is reseeded whenever /dev/random is
 * used, so if it is used often, then the nonblocking pool
 * will almost always be able to safely reseed from there.
 *
 * How many outputs can we safely take from a seeded pool?
 * ======================================================
 *
 * Too large a value will be insecure, but it is not clear what
 * "too large" means here. The question has been well studied
 * for counter mode block ciphers, but the analysis does not
 * apply directly here; at best it allows sensible guesses.
 *
 * For n-bit block size the Yarrow paper shows a generic attack
 * for any counter mode block cipher after 2^(n/3) output blocks,
 * about 2^42 for 128-bit block size, and one NIST document
 * suggests an absolute upper limit of 2^48 for AES-CTR.
 *
 * Real applications generally use a much lower limit. Here I
 * think a value for SAFE_OUT around 2^16 is the largest that
 * could reasonably be considered, perhaps the prime (2^16)+1.
 *
 * However, using that seems unnecessary; a much lower value
 * is enough to effectively decouple /dev/urandom and /devrandom.
 * We want a low enough value that going over it sometimes when
 * entropy is low will not be fatal.
 *
 * Even if /dev/random is not used, the nonblocking pool can reseed
 * from the blocking pool SAFE_OUT times before it needs to reseed
 * from a hardware rng or the input pool. Since it does SAFE_OUT
 * output blocks per reseed, it can produce SAFE_OUT*SAFE_OUT blocks
 * before it needs to reseed other than from the blocking pool.
 *
 * Using primes (just because), some possibilities are:
 *
 * with SAFE_OUT =   31,     almost   1,000 blocks
 * with SAFE_OUT =  101,     over    10,000 blocks
 * with SAFE_OUT =  331,     over   100,000 blocks
 * with SAFE_OUT =  503,     over   250,000 blocks
 * with SAFE_OUT = 1009,     over 1,000,000 blocks
 * with SAFE_OUT = (2^16)+1, over      2^32 blocks
 *
 * Any sensible value for SAFE_OUT will greatly reduce load on the
 * input pool when the nonblocking pool is heavily used.

 * 128-bit counter to mix in when hashing
 *
 * There is only one counter[] and three functions to update it,
 * count() to iterate it, buffer2counter() or counter_any()
 * to re-initialise it with a new starting value
 * 
 * mix_first() uses counter[] and calls count(), so the count both
 * affects and is affected by all output operations on any pool.
 *
 * Operations on this counter do not affect the per-pool counts
 * for any pool, neither the entropy count nor the r->count
 * iteration counter.
 *
 * One reason for including the counter is that it allows fast
 * initialisation. The very first output from the input pool is
 * used to update the counter. Once that is done, even if the
 * pools were all worthless, every output operation would still
 * have at least the strength of hash(constants, counter) which
 * is very roughly equivalent to a counter mode block cipher
 * encrypt(key,counter).
 *
 * mix_first() mixes in the counter so it affects all output from
 * any pool and all feedback into any pool. Every operation on any
 * pool changes the counter, so it automatically influences all the
 * other pools, albeit in an indirect and quite limited way.
 *
 * This can contribute to recovery after an rng state compromise.
 * Even knowing the counter value at one time an enemy cannot infer
 * the future effects unless he can predict the order of future
 * output operations, which depends on data requests from all sources.
 * Nor can he work backwards to get previous outputs unless he knows
 * the order of previous operations.
 *
 * This may provide almost no protection on a simple embedded system
 * or over a very short time span, since in those cases an enemy
 * might guess the sequence of operations or search through some
 * moderate number of possibilties. However it should be quite
 * effective for more complex systems and longer time spans.
