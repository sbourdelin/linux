menuconfig JTAG
	tristate "JTAG support"
	---help---
	  This provides basic core functionality support for jtag class devices
	  Hardware equipped with JTAG microcontroller which can be built
	  on top of this drivers. Driver exposes the set of IOCTL to the
	  user space for:
	  SIR (Scan Instruction Register, IEEE 1149.1 Data Register scan);
	  SDR (Scan Data Register, IEEE 1149.1 Instruction Register scan);
	  RUNTEST (Forces IEEE 1149.1 bus to a run state for specified
	  number of clocks).

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called jtag.

menuconfig JTAG_ASPEED
	tristate "Aspeed SoC JTAG controller support"
	depends on JTAG && HAS_IOMEM
	---help---
	  This provides a support for Aspeed JTAG device, equipped on
	  Aspeed SoC 24xx and 25xx families. Drivers allows programming
	  of hardware devices, connected to SoC through the JTAG interface.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called jtag-aspeed.
