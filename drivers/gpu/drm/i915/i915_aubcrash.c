/**
 * DOC: AubCrash
 *
 * This code is a companion to i915_gpu_error. The idea is that, on a GPU crash,
 * we can dump an AUB file that describes the state of the system at the point
 * of the crash (GTTs, contexts, BBs, BOs, etc...). While i915_gpu_error kind of
 * already does that, it uses a text format that is not specially human-friendly.
 * An AUB file, on the other hand, can be used by a number of tools (graphical
 * AUB file browsers, simulators, emulators, etc...) that facilitate debugging.
