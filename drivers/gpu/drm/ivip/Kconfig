		  Choose this option if you have an Intel FPGA Arria 10 system
		  and above with an Intel Display Port IP. This does not support
		  legacy Intel FPGA Cyclone V display port. Currently only single
		  frame buffer is supported. Note that ACPI and X_86 architecture
		  is not supported for Arria10. If M is selected the module will be
		  called ivip.
