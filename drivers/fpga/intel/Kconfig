	  Select this option to enable driver support for Intel(R)
	  Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) solutions. This driver
	  provides interfaces for userspace applications to configure,
	  enumerate, open, and access FPGA accelerators on platforms
	  equipped with Intel(R) FPGA solutions and enables system
	  level management functions such as FPGA reconfiguration,
	  power management, and virtualization.

	  Say Y if your platform has this technology. Say N if unsure.

	help
	  This is the driver for the PCIe device which locates between
	  CPU and Accelerated Function Units (AFUs) and allows them to
	  communicate with each other.
