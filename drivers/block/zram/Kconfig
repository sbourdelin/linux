	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

config ZRAM_DEDUP
	bool "Deduplication support for ZRAM data"
	depends on ZRAM
	default n
	help
	  Deduplicate ZRAM data to reduce amount of memory consumption.
	  Advantage largely depends on the workload. In some cases, this
	  option reduces memory usage to the half. However, if there is no
	  duplicated data, the amount of memory consumption would be
	  increased due to additional metadata usage. And, there is
	  computation time trade-off. Please check the benefit before
	  enabling this option. Experiment shows the positive effect when
	  the zram is used as blockdev and is used to store build output.
