          This module adds support for wireless adapters based on
          Atheros IEEE 802.11ac family of chipsets.

          If you choose to build a module, it'll be called ath10k.

	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables support for licensed channels on such as
          4.9 GHz (public safety).

	  These are PUBLIC SAFETY CHANNELS and MUST NOT BE USED in most
	  regulatory domains UNLESS YOU HAVE A FULL LICENSE for their use from
	  your local radio regulator, e.g. the FCC or equivalent. Using these
	  channels without proper authorisation may result in serious legal
	  consequences.

	  You will also have to build a regulatory database with these channels
	  enabled to actually use them.

	  If you are a distro kernel builder or have any doubt whatsoever about
	  your legal ability to use these channels, say N.
