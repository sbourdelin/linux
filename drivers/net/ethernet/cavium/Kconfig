	select THUNDER_NIC_BGX
	---help---
	  This driver supports Thunder's NIC physical function.
	  The NIC provides the controller and DMA engines to
	  move network traffic to/from the memory. The NIC
	  works closely with TNS, BGX and SerDes to implement the
	  functions replacing and virtualizing those of a typical
	  standalone PCIe NIC chip.

config THUNDER_NIC_VF
	tristate "Thunder Virtual function driver"
	depends on 64BIT
	---help---
	  This driver supports Thunder's NIC virtual function

	depends on 64BIT
	select PHYLIB
	select MDIO_THUNDER
	select THUNDER_NIC_RGX
	---help---
	  This driver supports programming and controlling of MAC
	  interface from NIC physical function driver.

config	THUNDER_NIC_RGX
	tristate "Thunder MAC interface driver (RGX)"
	depends on 64BIT
	select PHYLIB
	select MDIO_THUNDER

	  This driver supports Cavium LiquidIO Intelligent Server Adapters
	  based on CN66XX, CN68XX and CN23XX chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called liquidio.  This is recommended.

config LIQUIDIO_VF
	tristate "Cavium LiquidIO VF support"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI_MSI
	imply PTP_1588_CLOCK
	---help---
	  This driver supports Cavium LiquidIO Intelligent Server Adapter
	  based on CN23XX chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: The module
	  will be called liquidio_vf. MSI-X interrupt support is required
	  for this driver to work correctly
