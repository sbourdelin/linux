	---help---
	  I3C (pronounce: I-cube-C) is a serial protocol standardized by the
	  MIPI alliance.

	  It's supposed to be backward compatible with I2C while providing
	  support for high speed transfers and native interrupt support
	  without the need for extra pins.

	  The I3C protocol also standardizes the slave device types and is
	  mainly design to communicate with sensors.

	  If you want I3C support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your bus adapter(s) below.

	  This I3C support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i3c.
