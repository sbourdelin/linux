	bool "IBM On-Chip Controller"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support to monitor IBM Power CPU
	  sensors via the On-Chip Controller (OCC), from a service
	  processor.

	  Generally this is used by management controllers such as a BMC
	  on an OpenPower system.

if SENSORS_IBM_OCC

config SENSORS_IBM_OCC_P8_I2C
	tristate "POWER8 OCC hwmon support"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Provide a hwmon sysfs interface for the POWER8 On-Chip Controller,
	  exposing temperature, frequency and power measurements. This
	  interface runs on the service processor, not the POWER CPU.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called hwmon_occ_p8.
