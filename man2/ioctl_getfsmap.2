.TH IOCTL-GETFSMAP 2 2017-02-10 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
ioctl_getfsmap \- retrieve the physical layout of the filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/fs.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/fsmap.h>
.sp
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", GETFSMAP, struct fsmap_head * " arg );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This
.BR ioctl (2)
retrieves physical extent mappings for a filesystem.
This information can be used to discover which files are mapped to a physical
block, examine free space, or find known bad blocks, among other things.

The sole argument to this ioctl should be a pointer to a single
.BR "struct fsmap_head" ":"
.in +4n
.nf

struct fsmap {
	__u32		fmr_device;	/* device id */
	__u32		fmr_flags;	/* mapping flags */
	__u64		fmr_physical;	/* device offset of segment */
	__u64		fmr_owner;	/* owner id */
	__u64		fmr_offset;	/* file offset of segment */
	__u64		fmr_length;	/* length of segment */
	__u64		fmr_reserved[3];	/* must be zero */
};

struct fsmap_head {
	__u32		fmh_iflags;	/* control flags */
	__u32		fmh_oflags;	/* output flags */
	__u32		fmh_count;	/* # of entries in array incl. input */
	__u32		fmh_entries;	/* # of entries filled in (output). */
	__u64		fmh_reserved[6];	/* must be zero */

	struct fsmap	fmh_keys[2];	/* low and high keys for the mapping search */
	struct fsmap	fmh_recs[];	/* returned records */
};

.fi
.in
The two
.I fmh_keys
array elements specify the lowest and highest reverse-mapping
keys, respectively, for which userspace would like physical mapping
information.
A reverse mapping key consists of the tuple (device, block, owner, offset).
The owner and offset fields are part of the key because some filesystems
support sharing physical blocks between multiple files and
therefore may return multiple mappings for a given physical block.
.PP
Filesystem mappings are copied into the
.I fmh_recs
array, which immediately follows the header data.
.SS Fields of struct fsmap_head
.PP
The
.I fmh_iflags
field is a bitmask passed to the kernel to alter the output.
There are no flags defined, so this value must be zero.

.PP
The
.I fmh_oflags
field is a bitmask of flags that concern all output mappings.
If
.B FMH_OF_DEV_T
is set, then the
.I fmr_device
field represents a
.B dev_t
structure containing the major and minor numbers of the block device.

.PP
The
.I fmh_count
field contains the number of elements in the array being passed to the
kernel.
If this value is 0,
.I fmh_entries
will be set to the number of records that would have been returned had
the array been large enough;
no mapping information will be returned.

.PP
The
.I fmh_entries
field contains the number of elements in the
.I fmh_recs
array that contain useful information.

.PP
The
.I fmh_reserved
fields must be set to zero.

.SS Keys
.PP
The two key records in
.B fsmap_head.fmh_keys
specify the lowest and highest extent records in the keyspace that the caller
wants returned.
A filesystem that can share blocks between files likely requires the tuple
.RI "(" "device" ", " "physical" ", " "owner" ", " "offset" ", " "flags" ")"
to uniquely index any filesystem mapping record.
Classic non-sharing filesystems might be able to identify any record with only
.RI "(" "device" ", " "physical" ", " "flags" ")."
For example, if the low key is set to (0, 36864, 0, 0, 0), the filesystem will
only return records for extents starting at or above 36KiB on disk.
If the high key is set to (0, 1048576, 0, 0, 0), only records below 1MiB will
be returned.
By convention, the field
.B fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0]
must contain the low key and
.B fsmap_head.fmh_keys[1]
must contain the high key for the request.
.PP
For convenience, if
.B fmr_length
is set in the low key, it will be added to
.IR fmr_block " or " fmr_offset
as appropriate.
The caller can take advantage of this subtlety to set up subsequent calls
by copying
.B fsmap_head.fmh_recs[fsmap_head.fmh_entries - 1]
into the low key.
The function
.B fsmap_advance
provides this functionality.

.SS Fields of struct fsmap
.PP
The
.I fmr_device
field contains a 32-bit cookie to uniquely identify the underlying storage
device.
If the
.B FMH_OF_DEV_T
flag is set in the header's
.I fmh_oflags
field, this field contains a
.B dev_t
from which major and minor numbers can be extracted.
If the flag is not set, this field contains a value that must be unique
for each unique storage device.

.PP
The
.I fmr_physical
field contains the disk address of the extent in bytes.

.PP
The
.I fmr_owner
field contains the owner of the extent.
This is an inode number unless
.B FMR_OF_SPECIAL_OWNER
is set in the
.I fmr_flags
field, in which case the value is determined by the filesystem.
See the section below about special owner values for more details.

.PP
The
.I fmr_offset
field contains the logical address in the mapping record in bytes.
This field has no meaning if the
.BR FMR_OF_SPECIAL_OWNER " or " FMR_OF_EXTENT_MAP
flags are set in
.IR fmr_flags "."

.PP
The
.I fmr_length
field contains the length of the extent in bytes.

.PP
The
.I fmr_flags
field is a bitmask of extent state flags.
The bits are:
.RS 0.4i
.TP
.B FMR_OF_PREALLOC
The extent is allocated but not yet written.
.TP
.B FMR_OF_ATTR_FORK
This extent contains extended attribute data.
.TP
.B FMR_OF_EXTENT_MAP
This extent contains extent map information for the owner.
.TP
.B FMR_OF_SHARED
Parts of this extent may be shared.
.TP
.B FMR_OF_SPECIAL_OWNER
The
.I fmr_owner
field contains a special value instead of an inode number.
.TP
.B FMR_OF_LAST
This is the last record in the filesystem.
.RE

.PP
The
.I fmr_reserved
field will be set to zero.

.SS Special Owner Values
The following special owner values are generic to all filesystems:
