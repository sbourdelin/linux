/*
 * Library for dynamic allocation of pools of memory that can be,
 * after initialization, marked as read-only.
 *
 * This is intended to complement __read_only_after_init, for those cases
 * where either it is not possible to know the initialization value before
 * init is completed, or the amount of data is variable and can be
 * determined only at run-time.
 *
 * ***WARNING***
 * The user of the API is expected to synchronize:
 * 1) allocation,
 * 2) writes to the allocated memory,
 * 3) write protection of the pool,
 * 4) freeing of the allocated memory, and
 * 5) destruction of the pool.
 *
 * For a non-threaded scenario, this type of locking is not even required.
 *
 * Even if the library were to provide support for locking, point 2)
 * would still depend on the user taking the lock.
