Device hierarchy
================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.DeviceLE1 [Experimental]
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		void Connect()

			This is a generic method to connect low-level LE ACL
			and then (if needed) retrieve all GATT primary services.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotReady
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected

		void Disconnect()

			This method terminates low-level LE ACL connection.

			This method can be also used to cancel a preceding
			Connect call before a reply to it has been received.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotConnected

		void Pair()

			This method will connect to the remote device,
			initiate pairing and then retrieve all GATT primary
			services.

			If the application has registered its own agent,
			then that specific agent will be used. Otherwise
			it will use the default agent.

			Only for applications like a pairing wizard it
			would make sense to have its own agent. In almost
			all other cases the default agent will handle
			this just fine.

			In case there is no application agent and also
			no default agent present, this method will fail.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationCanceled
					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationFailed
					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationRejected
					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationTimeout
					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed

		void CancelPairing()

			This method can be used to cancel a pairing
			operation initiated by the Pair method.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

Properties	string Address [readonly]

			The Bluetooth device address of the remote device.

		string Name [readonly, optional]

			The Bluetooth remote name. This value can not be
			changed. Use the Alias property instead.

			This value is only present for completeness. It is
			better to always use the Alias property when
			displaying the devices name.

			If the Alias property is unset, it will reflect
			this value which makes it more convenient.

		string Icon [readonly, optional]

			Proposed icon name according to the freedesktop.org
			icon naming specification.

		uint16 Appearance [readonly, optional]

			External appearance of device, as found on GAP service.

		array{string} UUIDs [readonly, optional]

			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available
			remote services.

		boolean Paired [readonly]

			Indicates if the remote device is paired.

		boolean Connected [readonly]

			Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.

		boolean Trusted [readwrite]

			Indicates if the remote is seen as trusted. This
			setting can be changed by the application.

		boolean Blocked [readwrite]

			If set to true any incoming connections from the
			device will be immediately rejected. Any device
			drivers will also be removed and no new ones will
			be probed as long as the device is blocked.

		string Alias [readwrite]

			The name alias for the remote device. The alias can
			be used to have a different friendly name for the
			remote device.

			In case no alias is set, it will return the remote
			device name. Setting an empty string as alias will
			convert it back to the remote device name.

			When resetting the alias with an empty string, the
			property will default back to the remote name.

		object Adapter [readonly]

			The object path of the adapter the device belongs to.

		string Modalias [readonly, optional]

			Remote Device Information information in modalias format
			used by the kernel and udev.

		int16 RSSI [readonly, optional]

			Received Signal Strength Indicator of the remote
			device (advertising).

		int16 TxPower [readonly, optional, experimental]

			Advertised transmitted power level (advertising).

		dict ManufacturerData [readonly, optional]

			Manufacturer specific advertisement data. Keys are
			16 bits Manufacturer ID followed by its byte array
			value.

		dict ServiceData [readonly, optional]

			Service advertisement data. Keys are the UUIDs in
			string format followed by its byte array value.

		bool ServicesResolved [readonly, experimental]

			Indicate whether or not service discovery has been
			resolved.
