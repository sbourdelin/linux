/**
 * DOC: Users
 *
 * Different users can communicate via bus1, and many resources are shared
 * between multiple users. The bus1_user object represents the UID of a user,
 * like "struct user_struct" does in the kernel core. It is used to account
 * global resources, apply limits, and calculate quotas if different UIDs
 * communicate with each other.
 *
 * All dynamic resources have global per-user limits, which cannot be exceeded
 * by a user. They prevent a single user from exhausting local resources. Each
 * peer that is created is always owned by the user that initialized it. All
 * resources allocated on that peer are accounted on that pinned user.
 * Additionally to global resources, there are local limits per peer, that can
 * be controlled by each peer individually (e.g., specifying a maximum pool
 * size). Those local limits allow a user to distribute the globally available
 * resources across its peer instances.
 *
 * Since bus1 allows communication across UID boundaries, any such transmission
 * of resources must be properly accounted. Bus1 employs dynamic quotas to
 * fairly distribute available resources. Those quotas make sure that available
 * resources of a peer cannot be exhausted by remote UIDs, but are fairly
 * divided among all communicating peers.
