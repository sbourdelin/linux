USB port LED trigger
====================

This LED trigger can be used for signalling to the user a presence of USB device
in a given port. It simply turns on LED when device appears and turns it off
when it disappears.

It requires specifying a list of USB ports that should be observed. Used format
matches Linux kernel format and consists of a root hub number and a hub port
separated by a dash (e.g. 3-1).

It is also possible to handle devices with internal hubs (that are always
connected to the root hub). User can simply specify internal hub ports then
(e.g. 1-1.1, 1-1.2, etc.).

Please note that this trigger allows assigning multiple USB ports to a single
LED. This can be useful in two cases:

1) Device with single USB LED and few physical ports

In such a case LED will be turned on as long as there is at least one connected
USB device.

2) Device with a physical port handled by few controllers

Some devices have e.g. one controller per PHY standard. E.g. USB 3.0 physical
port may be handled by ohci-platform, ehci-platform and xhci-hcd. If there is
only one LED user will most likely want to assign ports from all 3 hubs.


This trigger can be activated from user space on led class devices as shown
below:

  echo usbport > trigger

This adds sysfs attributes to the LED that are documented in:
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-trigger-usbport

Example use-case:

  echo usbport > trigger
  echo 4-1 > new_port
  echo 2-1 > new_port
  ls ports
  echo 4-1 > remove_port
  ls ports
