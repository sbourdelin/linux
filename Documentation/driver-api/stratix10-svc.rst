Intel Stratix10 SoC Service Layer
=================================

Some features of the Intel Stratix10 SoC require a level of privilege
higher than the kernel is granted. Such secure features include
FPGA programming. In terms of the ARMv8 architecture, the kernel runs
at Exception Level 1 (EL1), access to the features requires
Exception Level 3 (EL3).

The Intel Stratix10 SoC service layer provides an in kernel API for
drivers to request access to the secure features. The requests are queued
and processed one by one. ARMâ€™s SMCCC is used to pass the execution
of the requests on to a secure monitor (EL3).
