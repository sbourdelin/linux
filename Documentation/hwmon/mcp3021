Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Microchip Technology MCP3021 and
MCP3221 chip.

The Microchip Technology Inc. MCP3021 is a successive approximation A/D
converter (ADC) with 10-bit resolution. The MCP3221 has 12-bit resolution.

These devices provide one single-ended input with very low power consumption.
Communication to the MCP3021/MCP3221  is performed using a 2-wire I2C
compatible interface. Standard (100 kHz) and Fast (400 kHz) I2C modes are
available. The default I2C device address is 0x4d (contact the Microchip
factory for additional address options).

The reference voltage used in the conversion can be set through platform data
in millivolt (for backwards compatibility) or via device tree in microvolt.
Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/mcp3021.txt for details
about the device tree bindings.
