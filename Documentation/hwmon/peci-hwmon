Description
-----------

This driver implements a generic PECI hwmon feature which provides Digital
Thermal Sensor (DTS) thermal readings of the CPU package, CPU cores and DIMM
components that are accessible using the PECI Client Command Suite via the
processor PECI client.

All temperature values are given in millidegree Celsius and will be measurable
only when the target CPU is powered on.

sysfs attributes
----------------

temp1_input		Provides current die temperature of the CPU package.
temp1_max		Provides thermal control temperature of the CPU package
			which is also known as Tcontrol.
temp1_crit		Provides shutdown temperature of the CPU package which
			is also known as the maximum processor junction
			temperature, Tjmax or Tprochot.
temp1_crit_hyst		Provides the hysteresis value from Tcontrol to Tjmax of
			the CPU package.

temp2_input		Provides current DTS thermal margin to Tcontrol of the
			CPU package. Value 0 means it reaches to Tcontrol
			temperature. Sub-zero value means the die temperature
			goes across Tconrtol to Tjmax.
temp2_min		Provides the minimum DTS thermal margin to Tcontrol of
			the CPU package.
temp2_lcrit		Provides the value when the CPU package temperature
			reaches to Tjmax.

temp3_input		Provides current Tcontrol temperature of the CPU
			package which is also known as Fan Temperature target.
			Indicates the relative value from thermal monitor trip
			temperature at which fans should be engaged.
temp3_crit		Provides Tcontrol critical value of the CPU package
			which is same to Tjmax.

temp4_input		Provides current Tthrottle temperature of the CPU
			package. Used for throttling temperature. If this value
			is allowed and lower than Tjmax - the throttle will
			occur and reported at lower than Tjmax.

temp5_input		Provides the maximum junction temperature, Tjmax of the
			CPU package.

temp<n>_label		Provides core temperature if this label indicates
			'Core #'.
temp[n]_input		Provides current temperature of each core.
temp[n]_max		Provides thermal control temperature of the core.
temp[n]_crit		Provides shutdown temperature of the core.
temp[n]_crit_hyst	Provides the hysteresis value from Tcontrol to Tjmax of
			the core.

temp<n>_label		Provides DDR DIMM temperature if this label indicates
			'DIMM #'.
temp<n>_input		Provides current temperature of the DDR DIMM.

Note:
	DIMM temperature group will be appeared when the client CPU's BIOS
	completes memory training and testing.
