Description
-----------

This driver implements a generic PECI hwmon feature which provides Digital
Thermal Sensor (DTS) thermal readings of the CPU package and CPU cores that are
accessible using the PECI Client Command Suite via the processor PECI client.

All temperature values are given in millidegree Celsius and will be measurable
only when the target CPU is powered on.

sysfs attributes
----------------

temp1_label		"Die"
temp1_input		Provides current die temperature of the CPU package.
temp1_max		Provides thermal control temperature of the CPU package
			which is also known as Tcontrol.
temp1_crit		Provides shutdown temperature of the CPU package which
			is also known as the maximum processor junction
			temperature, Tjmax or Tprochot.
temp1_crit_hyst		Provides the hysteresis value from Tcontrol to Tjmax of
			the CPU package.

temp2_label		"Tcontrol"
temp2_input		Provides current Tcontrol temperature of the CPU
			package which is also known as Fan Temperature target.
			Indicates the relative value from thermal monitor trip
			temperature at which fans should be engaged.
temp2_crit		Provides Tcontrol critical value of the CPU package
			which is same to Tjmax.

temp3_label		"Tthrottle"
temp3_input		Provides current Tthrottle temperature of the CPU
			package. Used for throttling temperature. If this value
			is allowed and lower than Tjmax - the throttle will
			occur and reported at lower than Tjmax.

temp4_label		"Tjmax"
temp4_input		Provides the maximum junction temperature, Tjmax of the
			CPU package.

temp[5-*]_label		Provides string "Core X", where X is resolved core
			number.
temp[5-*]_input		Provides current temperature of each core.
temp[5-*]_max		Provides thermal control temperature of the core.
temp[5-*]_crit		Provides shutdown temperature of the core.
temp[5-*]_crit_hyst	Provides the hysteresis value from Tcontrol to Tjmax of
			the core.
