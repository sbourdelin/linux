Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the OCC (On-Chip Controller) on the IBM
POWER8 and POWER9 processors, from a BMC (Baseboard Management Controller). The
OCC is an embedded processor that provides real time power and thermal
monitoring.

This driver provides an interface on a BMC to poll OCC sensor data, set user
power caps, and perform some basic OCC error handling.

Currently, all versions of the OCC support four types of sensor data: power,
temperature, frequency, and "caps," which indicate limits and thresholds used
internally on the OCC.

BMC - Host Communications
-------------------------

For the POWER8 application, the BMC can communicate with the P8 over I2C bus.
However, to access the OCC register space, any data transfer must use a SCOM
operation. SCOM is a procedure to initiate a data transfer, typically of 8
bytes. SCOMs consist of writing a 32-bit command register and then
reading/writing two 32-bit data registers. This driver implements these
SCOM operations over I2C bus in order to communicate with the OCC.

For the POWER9 application, the BMC can communicate with the P9 over FSI bus
and SBE engine. Once again, SCOM operations are required. This driver will
implement SCOM ops over FSI/SBE. This will require the FSI driver.
