Kernel driver generic-pwm-tachometer
====================================

This driver enables the use of a PWM module to monitor a fan. It uses the
generic PWM interface and can be used on SoCs as along as the SoC supports
Tachometer controller that moniors the Fan speed in periods.

Description
-----------

The driver implements a simple interface for monitoring the Fan speed using
PWM module and Tachometer controller. It requests period value through PWM
capture interface to Tachometer and measures the Rotations per minute using
received period value. It exposes the Fan speed in RPM to the user space by
using the hwmon's sysfs interface.
