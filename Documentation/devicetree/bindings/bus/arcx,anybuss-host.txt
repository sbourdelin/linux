* Arcx Anybus-S host

This host communicates with the SoC over a parallel bus. It is
expected that its Device Tree node is specified as the child of a node
corresponding to the parallel bus used for communication.

Required properties:

  - compatible : The following string:
        "arcx,anybuss-host"

  - reg : bus memory area where the Anybus-S host dpram is located.

  - interrupts : interrupt connected to the Anybus-S host interrupt line.
	Generic interrupt client node bindings are described in
		interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  - resets : the reset line associated with the Anybus-S host.

Example of usage:

This example places the Anybus-S host on top of the i.MX WEIM parallel bus, see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/imx-weim.txt

&weim {
	anybus-host@0 {
		compatible = "arcx,anybuss-host";
		reg = <0 0x400000 0x800>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		resets = <&anybus_bridge 0>;
		/* fsl,weim-cs-timing is a i.MX WEIM bus specific property */
		fsl,weim-cs-timing = <0x024400b1 0x00001010 0x20081100
				0x00000000 0xa0000240 0x00000000>;
	};
};
