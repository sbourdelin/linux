Fixed Voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "regulator-fixed";
- regulator-name: Defined in regulator.txt as optional, but required here.

Optional properties:
- gpio: gpio to use for enable control
- startup-delay-us: startup time in microseconds
- enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is Active high
  If this property is missing, the default assumed is Active low.
  If the phandle flags to the GPIO handle also flag the line as active
  low or high, that will be ignored for fixed regulators and the
  presence or absence of this flag solely controls the inversion
  semantics.
-vin-supply: Input supply name.

Deprecated properties:
- gpio-open-drain: GPIO is open drain type.
  If this property is missing then default assumption is false.
  Do not use this property in new device trees: instead use the
  phandle flag to indicate to the GPIO provider that the line
  should be handled as open drain.

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.
However a fixed voltage regulator is expected to have the
regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt
to be the same.

Example:

	abc: fixedregulator@0 {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name = "fixed-supply";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1800000>;
		gpio = <&gpio1 16 0>;
		startup-delay-us = <70000>;
		enable-active-high;
		regulator-boot-on;
		gpio-open-drain;
		vin-supply = <&parent_reg>;
	};
