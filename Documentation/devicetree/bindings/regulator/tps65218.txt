TPS65218 family of regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,tps65218"
- reg: I2C slave address

- List of regulators provided by this controller, must be named
  after their hardware counterparts: dcdc[1-6] and ldo1
- This is the list of child nodes that specify the regulator
  initialization data for defined regulators. Not all regulators for the given
  device need to be present. The definition for each of these nodes is defined
  using the standard binding for regulators found at ./regulator.txt.

  The valid names for regulators are:
  tps65217: regulator-dcdc1, regulator-dcdc2, regulator-dcdc3, regulator-dcdc4,
  regulator-dcdc5, regulator-dcdc6, regulator-ldo1, regulator-ls3.
  Each regulator is defined using the standard binding for regulators.

Optional properties:
  If any of these properties is absent then the corresponding setting will be
  untouched.
- ti,strict-supply-voltage-supervision: Set/Reset STRICT flag in CONFIG1.
  The supervisor has two modes of operation, controlled by the STRICT bit.
  With the STRICT bit set to 0, all five rails are monitored for under-voltage
  only with relaxed thresholds and deglitch times.
  With the STRCT bit set to 1, all five rails are monitored for under-voltage
  and over-voltage with tight limits and short deglitch times.
- ti,under-voltage-limit-microvolt: Configures UVLO in CONFIG1.
  Valid values are: 2750000, 2950000, 3250000, 3350000
- ti,under-voltage-hyst-microvolt: Select 200mV or 400mV UVLOHYS in CONFIG2
  Power rails are only enabled if the input voltage measured at the IN_BIAS pin
  is greater than the under-voltage lockout threshold plus hysteresis
  (UVLO + UVLOHYS). Once the input voltage rises above this level,
  the input voltage may drop to the UVLO level before the PMIC shuts down.
  UVLO is deglitched by 5 ms on rising and falling edge.
