ROHM BD71837 Power Management Integrated Circuit clock bindings

This is a part of device tree bindings of ROHM BD71837 multi-function
device. See generic BD71837 MFD bindings at:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71837-pmic.txt

BD71837 contains one 32,768 KHz clock output which can be enabled and
disabled via i2c.

Following properties should be present in main device node of the MFD chip.

Required properties:
- clock-frequency	: Should be 32768
- #clock-cells		: Should be 0

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names	: Should contain name for output clock.

Example:

/* MFD node */

pmic: pmic@4b {
	compatible = "rohm,bd71837";
	/* ... */
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency  = <32768>;
	/* ... */
};

/* Clock consumer node */

foo@0 {
	compatible = "bar,foo";
	/* ... */
	clock-names = "my-clock";
	clocks = <&pmic>;
};
