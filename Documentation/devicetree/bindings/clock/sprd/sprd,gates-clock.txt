Spreadtrum gate clock driver

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Spreadtrum's SoCs often use one register to control more than one gate clocks.
Clock consumers can use index to get the correct gate clock.

In Spreadtrum platform, some of gate clocks have three registers, respectively
used for controlling, setting and clearing gate clock, the addresses of
these three registers generally are <start>, <start + offset>, and
<start + offset * 2>, and offset would be 0x1000 or 0x100, so the register
size of gate clocks is either 0x3000 or 0x300. While for some historical issue
there also are some clocks which don't have independent set/clear registers.
Please see bellow for more specific information.

Required properties:

- compatible:	should be one of the following:
		"sprd,sc1000-gates-clock"
		- offset of the registers for setting gate is 0x1000

		"sprd,sc100-gates-clock"
		- offset of the registers for setting gate is 0x100

		"sprd,gates-clock"
		- for clocks without independent set/clear registers

- reg:	the first cell represents the address of this clock gate controller
	register, the second cell implies how is the offset of set/clear
	registers of this clock gate, like addressed in the head of this
	file

optional properties:

- clock-indices:	If the identifying number for the clocks in the node
			is not linear from zero, this property is necessary

Example:

	clk_mpll_gates: clk@402b00b0 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc1000-gates-clock";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0 0x402b00b0 0 0x3000>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>;
		clock-indices = <2>, <18>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll0_gate", "clk_mpll1_gate";
	};

Below are two examples of how consumers use the gate clock.
The 'clk_mpll0' uses index 2 of 'clk_mpll_gates' and 'clk_mpll1'
uses index 18.

Examples:

	clk_mpll0: clk@40400024 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9860-adjustable-pll-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x40400024 0 0x4>,
		      <0 0x40400028 0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_mpll_gates 2>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll0";
	};

	clk_mpll1: clk@4040002c {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9860-adjustable-pll-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0x4040002c 0 0x4>,
		      <0 0x40400030 0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_mpll_gates 18>;
		clock-output-names = "clk_mpll1";
	};
