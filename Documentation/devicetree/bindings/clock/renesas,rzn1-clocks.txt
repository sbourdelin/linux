* Renesas RZ/N1 Clock Driver

This driver provides the clock infrastructure used by all the other drivers.

One of the 'special' feature of this infrastructure is that Linux doesn't
necessary 'own' all the clocks on the SoC, some other OS runs on
the Cortex-M3 core and that OS can access and claim it's own clocks.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be
    - "renesas,r9a06g032-clocks" for the RZ/N1D
    and "renesas,rzn1-clocks" as a fallback.
  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the driver
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1

Examples
--------

  - Clock driver device node:

	clock: clocks@4000c000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r9a06g032-clocks",
				"renesas,rzn1-clocks";
		reg = <0x4000c000 0x1000>;
		status = "okay";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};


  - Other drivers can use the clocks as in:

	uart0: serial@40060000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
		reg = <0x40060000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg-shift = <2>;
		reg-io-width = <4>;
		clocks = <&clock RZN1_CLK_UART0>;
		clock-names = "baudclk";
	};
    Note the use of RZN1_CLK_UART0 -- these constants are declared in
    the rzn1-clocks.h header file. These are not hardware based constants
    and are Linux specific.
