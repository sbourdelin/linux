Ingenic SoC TCU binding

The TCU is the Timer/Counter Unit present in all Ingenic SoCs. It features 8
channels, each one having its own clock, that can be started and stopped,
reparented, and reclocked.

Required properties:
- compatible : One of:
  * ingenic,jz4740-tcu-clocks,
  * ingenic,jz4770-tcu-clocks,
  * ingenic,jz4780-tcu-clocks.
- clocks : List of phandle & clock specifiers for clocks external to the TCU.
  The "pclk", "rtc" and "ext" clocks should be provided.
- clock-names : List of name strings for the external clocks.
- #clock-cells: Should be 1.
  Clock consumers specify this argument to identify a clock. The valid values
  may be found in <dt-bindings/clock/ingenic,tcu.h>.

Example:

/ {
	regmap {
		compatible = "simple-mfd", "syscon";
		reg = <0x10002000 0x1000>;

		tcu: clocks {
			compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-tcu-clocks";

			clocks = <&ext>, <&rtc>, <&pclk>;
			clock-names = "ext", "rtc", "pclk";

			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
};
