Binding for the i.MX6 EPIT timer

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,imx6q-epit"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: Should contain EPIT controller interrupt
- clocks: list of clock specifiers, must contain an entry for each required
  entry in clock-names
- clock-names : as described in the clock bindings

Example:
	epit1: epit@20d0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-epit";
		reg = <0x020d0000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <0 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_EPIT1>,
			<&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_IPG_PER>,
			<&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_CKIL>;
		clock-names = "ipg", "per", "ckil";
	};
