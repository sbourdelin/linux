* Amlogic MMC Sub Clock Controller Driver

The Amlogic MMC clock controller generates and supplies clock to support
MMC and NAND controller

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be:
		"amlogic,gx-mmc-clkc"
		"amlogic,axg-mmc-clkc"

- #clock-cells: should be 1.
- clocks: phandles to clocks corresponding to the clock-names property
- clock-names: list of parent clock names
	- "clkin0", "clkin1"

Parent node should have the following properties :
- compatible: "amlogic,axg-mmc-clkc", "syscon".
- reg: base address and size of the MMC control register space.

Example: Clock controller node:

sd_mmc_c_clkc: clock-controller@7000 {
	compatible = "amlogic,axg-mmc-clkc", "syscon";
	reg = <0x0 0x7000 0x0 0x4>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;

	clock-names = "clkin0", "clkin1";
	clocks = <&clkc CLKID_SD_MMC_C_CLK0>,
		 <&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV2>;
};
