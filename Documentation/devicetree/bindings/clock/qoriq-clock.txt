* Clock Block on Freescale QorIQ Platforms

Freescale QorIQ chips take primary clocking input from the external
SYSCLK signal. The SYSCLK input (frequency) is multiplied using
multiple phase locked loops (PLL) to create a variety of frequencies
which can then be passed to a variety of internal logic, including
cores and peripheral IP blocks.
Please refer to the Reference Manual for details.

All references to "1.0" and "2.0" refer to the QorIQ chassis version to
which the chip complies.

Chassis Version		Example Chips
---------------		-------------
1.0			p4080, p5020, p5040
2.0			t4240, b4860

1. Clock Block Binding

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain a chip-specific clock block compatible
	string and (if applicable) may contain a chassis-version clock
	compatible string.

	Chip-specific strings are of the form "fsl,<chip>-clockgen", such as:
	* "fsl,p2041-clockgen"
	* "fsl,p3041-clockgen"
	* "fsl,p4080-clockgen"
	* "fsl,p5020-clockgen"
	* "fsl,p5040-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t1023-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t1024-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t1040-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t1042-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t2080-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t2081-clockgen"
	* "fsl,t4240-clockgen"
	* "fsl,b4420-clockgen"
	* "fsl,b4860-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls1012a-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls1021a-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls1043a-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls1046a-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls1088a-clockgen"
	* "fsl,ls2080a-clockgen"
	Chassis-version clock strings include:
	* "fsl,qoriq-clockgen-1.0": for chassis 1.0 clocks
	* "fsl,qoriq-clockgen-2.0": for chassis 2.0 clocks
- reg: Describes the address of the device's resources within the
	address space defined by its parent bus, and resource zero
	represents the clock register set

Optional properties:
- ranges: Allows valid translation between child's address space and
	parent's. Must be present if the device has sub-nodes.
- #address-cells: Specifies the number of cells used to represent
	physical base addresses.  Must be present if the device has
	sub-nodes and set to 1 if present
- #size-cells: Specifies the number of cells used to represent
	the size of an address. Must be present if the device has
	sub-nodes and set to 1 if present
- clock-frequency: Input system clock frequency (SYSCLK)
- clocks: If clock-frequency is not specified, sysclk may be provided
	as an input clock.  Either clock-frequency or clocks must be
	provided.
	A second input clock, called "coreclk", may be provided if
	core PLLs are based on a different input clock from the
	platform PLL.
- clock-names: Required if a coreclk is present.  Valid names are
	"sysclk" and "coreclk".

2. Clock Provider

The clockgen node should act as a clock provider, though in older device
trees the children of the clockgen node are the clock providers.

When the clockgen node is a clock provider, #clock-cells = <2>.
The first cell of the clock specifier is the clock type, and the
second cell is the clock index for the specified type.

	Type#	Name		Index Cell
	0	sysclk		must be 0
	1	cmux		index (n in CLKCnCSR)
	2	hwaccel		index (n in CLKCGnHWACSR)
	3	fman		0 for fm1, 1 for fm2
	4	platform pll	0=pll, 1=pll/2, 2=pll/3, 3=pll/4
				4=pll/5, 5=pll/6, 6=pll/7, 7=pll/8
	5	coreclk		must be 0

3. Example

	clockgen: global-utilities@e1000 {
		compatible = "fsl,p5020-clockgen", "fsl,qoriq-clockgen-1.0";
		clock-frequency = <133333333>;
		reg = <0xe1000 0x1000>;
		#clock-cells = <2>;
	};

	fman@400000 {
		...
		clocks = <&clockgen 3 0>;
		...
	};
}
