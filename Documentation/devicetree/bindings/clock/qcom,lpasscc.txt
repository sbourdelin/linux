Qualcomm LPASS Clock Controller Binding
-----------------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible	: shall contain "qcom,sdm845-lpasscc"
- #clock-cells	: from common clock binding, shall contain 1.

Note that #address-cells, #size-cells, and ranges shall be present to ensure
the lpasscc can address the various lpass cc registers.

Child Node Properties :
The Low Pass Audio clock controller would need to define the following child
nodes with the properties.
- compatible	: shall contain all of the below for clocks in each LPASS domain
			"qcom,sdm845-lpass-gcc",
			"qcom,sdm845-lpass-cc",
			"qcom,sdm845-lpass-qdsp6ss"
- reg		: shall contain base register address and size,

Example:

The below node has to be defined in the cases where the LPASS peripheral loader
would bring the subsystem out of reset.

	lpasscc: clock-controller {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-lpasscc";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
	                #address-cells = <1>;
		        #size-cells = <1>;
			ranges;

			lpass_gcc@100000 {
				compatible = "qcom,sdm845-lpass-gcc";
				reg = <0x00147000 0x20>;
			};

			lpass@17014000 {
				compatible = "qcom,sdm845-lpass-cc";
				reg = <0x17014000 0x1f004>;
			};

			lpass_q6@17300020 {
				compatible = "qcom,sdm845-lpass-qdsp6ss";
				reg = <0x17300020 0x20>;
			};
		 };
