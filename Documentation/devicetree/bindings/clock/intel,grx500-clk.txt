Device Tree Clock bindings for GRX500 PLL controller.

This binding uses the common clock binding:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

This GRX500 PLL controller provides the 5 main clock domain of the SoC: CPU/DDR, XBAR,
Voice, WLAN, PCIe and gate clocks for HW modules.

Required properties for osc clock node
- compatible: Should be intel,grx500-xxx-clk
- reg: offset address of the controller memory area.
- clocks: phandle of the external reference clock
- #clock-cells: can be one or zero.
- clock-output-names: Names of the output clocks.

Example:
	pll0aclk: pll0aclk {
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "intel,grx500-pll0a-clk";
		clocks = <&pll0a>;
		reg = <0x8>;
		clock-output-names = "cbmclk", "ngiclk", "ssx4clk", "cpu0clk";
	};

	cpuclk: cpuclk {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "intel,grx500-cpu-clk";
		clocks = <&pll0aclk CPU0_CLK>, <&pll0bclk CPU1_CLK>;
		reg = <0x8>;
		clock-output-names = "cpu";
	};

Required properties for gate node:
- compatible: Should be intel,grx500-gatex-clk
- reg: offset address of the controller memory area.
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>
- clock-output-names: Names of the output clocks.

Example:
	clkgate0: clkgate0 {
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "intel,grx500-gate0-clk";
		reg = <0x114>;
		clock-output-names = "gate_xbar0", "gate_xbar1", "gate_xbar2",
		"gate_xbar3", "gate_xbar6", "gate_xbar7";
	};
