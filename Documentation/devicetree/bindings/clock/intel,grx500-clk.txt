Device Tree Clock bindings for grx500 PLL controller.

This binding uses the common clock binding:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

The grx500 clock controller supplies clock to various controllers within the
SoC.

Required properties for clock node
- compatible: Should be "intel,grx500-cgu".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory range.
- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Optional Propteries:
- intel,osc-frequency: frequency of the osc clock.
if missing, driver will use clock rate defined in the driver.

Example: Clock controller node:

	cgu: cgu@16200000 {
                compatible = "intel,grx500-cgu", "syscon";
		reg = <0x16200000 0x200>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};


Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by clock
	controller.

	asc0: serial@16600000 {
		compatible = "lantiq,asc";
		reg = <0x16600000 0x100000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			<GIC_SHARED 105 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			<GIC_SHARED 106 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cgu CLK_SSX4>, <&cgu GCLK_UART>;
		clock-names = "freq", "asc";
	};
