GPIO driver for MAX77650 PMIC from Maxim Integrated.

This module is part of the MAX77650 MFD device. For more details
see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/max77650.txt.

The GPIO controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node on
the device tree.

This device has a single GPIO pin.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Must be "maxim,max77650-gpio"
- gpio-controller : 	Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells : 	Must be <2>. The first cell is the pin number and
			the second cell is used to specify the gpio active
			state.

Optional properties:
--------------------
gpio-line-names:	Single string containing the name of the GPIO line.

For more details, please refer to the generic GPIO DT binding document
<devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt>.

Example:
--------

	gpio {
		compatible = "maxim,max77650-gpio";
		gpio-line-names = "max77650-charger";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};
