Cirrus Logic Madera class audio codecs gpio driver

This is a subnode of the parent mfd node.

See also the core bindings for the parent MFD driver:
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/madera.txt

Required properties:
  - compatible : must be "cirrus,madera-gpio"
  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number. The second cell
    is reserved for future use and must be zero

Example:

codec: cs47l85@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l85";

	gpio {
		compatible = "cirrus,madera-gpio";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	}
};
