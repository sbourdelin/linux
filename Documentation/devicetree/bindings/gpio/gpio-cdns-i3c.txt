* Cadence I3C GPIO expander

The Cadence I3C GPIO expander provides 8 GPIOs controllable over I3C.
This GPIOs can be configured in output or input mode and if they are in input
mode they can generate IBIs (In Band Interrupts).

Required properties for GPIO node:
- reg : 3 cells encoding the I3C static address (none in our case) and the I3C
	Provisional ID. See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i3c/i3c.txt for
	more details.
	Should be <0x0 0x392 0x0>.
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH or
  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells : Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number.
  The second cell is used to specify trigger type and level flags.
  The following trigger types are accepted (see
  <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h> for their definition):
	IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
	IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING
	IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
	IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH
	IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW

Example:

	i3c-master@xxx {
		...
		i3c_gpio_expander: gpio@0,39200000000 {
			reg = <0 0x392 0x0>;
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		};
		...
	};
