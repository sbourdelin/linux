Rockchip RK3328 GPIO controller dedicated for the GPIO_MUTE pin.

In Rockchip RK3328, the output only GPIO_MUTE pin, originally for codec mute
control, can also be used for general purpose. It is manipulated by the
GRF_SOC_CON10 register.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "rockchip,rk3328-gpio-mute".
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the pin number and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
    0 = Active high,
    1 = Active low.

Example:

	grf: syscon@ff100000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3328-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";

		gpio_mute: gpio-mute {
			compatible = "rockchip,rk3328-gpio-mute";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
	};

Note: The gpio_mute node should be declared as the child of the GRF (General
Register File) node. The GPIO_MUTE pin is referred to as <&gpio_mute 0>.
