* Generic 8-bits shift register GPIO driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    "fairchild,74hc595"
    "nxp,74lvc594"
- reg : chip select number
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
      0 = active high
      1 = active low
- registers-number: Number of daisy-chained shift registers

Optional properties:
- enable-gpios: GPIO connected to the OE (Output Enable) pin.
- lines-initial-states: Bitmask that specifies the initial state of
  each line. When a bit is set to zero, the corresponding output line
  is initialized LOW. When a bit is set to one, the corresponding
  output line is initialized HIGH. In case this property is not
  defined, all lines will be initialized as LOW.

Example:

gpio5: gpio5@0 {
	compatible = "fairchild,74hc595";
	reg = <0>;
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
	registers-number = <4>;
	spi-max-frequency = <100000>;
};
