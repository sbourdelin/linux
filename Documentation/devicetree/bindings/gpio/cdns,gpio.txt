Cadence GPIO controller bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "cdns,gpio-r1p02".
- reg: the register base address and size.
- #gpio-cells: should be 2.
  * first cell is the GPIO number.
  * second cell specifies the GPIO flags, as defined in
    <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
    flags are supported.
- gpio-controller: marks the device as a GPIO controller.
- clocks: should contain one entry referencing the peripheral clock driving the
  GPIO controller.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts: interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- interrupt-controller: marks the device as an interrupt controller. When
  defined, interrupts, interrupt-parent and #interrupt-cells are required.
- interrupt-cells: should be 2.
  * first cell is the GPIO number you want to use as an IRQ source.
  * second cell specifies the IRQ type, as defined in
    <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>.

Example:

	gpio-controller@d050000 {
		compatible = "cdns,gpio";
		reg = <0xd050000 0x10000>;

		clocks = <&gpio_pclk>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;

		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	};
