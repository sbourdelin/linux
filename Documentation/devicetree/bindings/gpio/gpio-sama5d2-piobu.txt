GPIO controller for SAMA5D2 PIOBU pins.

This pins have the property of not losing their voltage
during Backup/Self-refresh mode.

These bindings should be set to a node in the dtsi file.

Required properties:
- compatible:		"syscon", "microchip,sama5d2-piobu"
- #gpio-cells:		There are 2. The pin number is the
			first, the second represents additional
			parameters such as GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH/LOW.
- gpio-controller:	Marks the port as GPIO controller.

Example:

	secumod@fc040000 {
		compatible = "syscon", "microchip,sama5d2-piobu";
		reg = <0xfc040000 0x100>;

		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};
