GPIO controller for SAMA5D2 PIOBU pins.

These pins have the property of not losing their voltage
during Backup/Self-refresh mode.

These bindings should be set to a node in the dtsi file.

Required properties:
- compatible:		"syscon", "microchip,sama5d2-piobu"
- #gpio-cells:		There are 2. The pin number is the
			first, the second represents additional
			parameters such as GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH/LOW.
- gpio-controller:	Marks the port as GPIO controller.

Note that the driver uses syscon and should be the child of
the syscon node.

Example:

	secumod@fc040000 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-secumod", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		status = "okay";
		reg = <0xfc040000 0x100>;

		pioBU: piobu {
			status = "okay";
			compatible = "microchip,sama5d2-piobu";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
	};
