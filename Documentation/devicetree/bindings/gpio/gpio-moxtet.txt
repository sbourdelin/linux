Turris Mox Moxtet GPIO expander

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "cznic,moxtet-gpio".
 - gpio-controller	: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells		: Should be two. For consumer use see gpio.txt.
 - moxtet,input-mask	: Bitmask. Those bits which correspond to input GPIOs
			  when read from Moxtet bus should be set here.
			  For example if bit 0 and bit 3 are input GPIO bits,
			  this should be set to 0x9.
			  Since there are only 4 input bits, 0xf is max value.
 - moxtet,output-mask	: Bitmask. Those bits which correspond to output GPIOs
			  when written to Moxtet bus should be set here.
			  For example if bit 1 and bit 6 are output GPIO bits,
			  this should be set to 0x41.
			  Since there are at most 8 output bits, 0xff is max
			  value.
Other properties are required for a moxtet bus device, please refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/moxtet.txt.

Example:

	moxtet_sfp: moxtet-sfp@0 {
		compatible = "cznic,moxtet-gpio";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells;
		reg = <0>;
		moxtet,id = <1>;
		moxtet,input-mask = <0x7>;
		moxtet,output-mask = <0x3>;
	}
