* TPS65086 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "ti,tps65086".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to he parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, this
			    should be 2. The first cell is the IRQ number,
			    the second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger
			    masks from <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>.

Additional nodes defined in:
 - Regulators	: ../regulator/tps65086-regulator.txt
 - GPIO		: ../gpio/gpio-tps65086.txt

Example:

	pmic: tps65086@5e {
		compatible = "ti,tps65086";
		reg = <0x5e>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

		regulators {
			compatible = "ti,tps65086-regulator";

			buck1 {
				regulator-name = "vcc1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1600000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1600000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				ti,regulator-decay;
				ti,regulator-step-size-25mv;
			};
		};

		gpio4: gpio {
			compatible = "ti,tps65086-gpio";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
	};
