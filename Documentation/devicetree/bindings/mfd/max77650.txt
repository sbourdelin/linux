Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible:		Must be "maxim,max77650"
- reg:			I2C device address.
- interrupts:		The interrupt on the parent the controller is
			connected to.
- interrupt-parent:	phandle of the parent interrupt controller.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells:	Must be <2>.

For device-tree bindings of sub-modules (regulator, power supply, GPIO, LEDs
and onkey) refer to the binding documents under the respective sub-system
directories.

Example:
--------

	pmic: max77650@48 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77650";
		reg = <0x48>;

		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	};
