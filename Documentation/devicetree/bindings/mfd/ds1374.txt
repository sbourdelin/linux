* Device tree bindings for Maxim/Dallas DS1374 Multi Function Device (MFD)

The Maxim/Dallas DS1374 is a multi function device that combines rtc,
watchdog or alarm, as well as trickle charger.

The DS1374 is connected via I2C.

Required properties:
- compatible: "dallas,ds1374"
- reg: I2C slave address
- dallas,ds1374-mode: Should be one of the following values:
			<0> for RTC
			<1> for RTC + Alarm (Interrupt)
			<2> for RTC + Watchdog

Required child:
A single available child device of type matching the "dallas,ds1374-mode"
property.

Optional properties (watchdog):
- dallas,ds1374-remap-wdt-reset: Boolean describing whether the INT pin
				 on the device is used as interrupt for
				 the alarm

See ../watchdog/* for generic watchdog bindings.

Optional properties (real time clock):
- interrupt: phandle to interrupt cell for the rtc's alarm feature

See ../rtc/* for generic rtc bindings.

Optional properties (trickle-charger):
- dallas,trickle-resistor-ohms : Selected resistor for trickle charger
	Values usable for ds1374 are 250, 2000, 4000
	Should be given if trickle charger should be enabled
- dallas,trickle-diode-disable : Do not use internal trickle charger diode
	Should be given if internal trickle charger diode should be disabled

Example for rtc with alarm mode and interrupt:

i2c@12ca0000 {
	rtc@68 {
		compatible = "ds1374";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupts = <&gpio0 62>;
		dallas,ds1374-mode = <2>

		dallas,trickle-resistor-ohms = <250>;
		dallas,trickle-diode-disable;
	};
};

Example for rtc with watchdog and reset on timeout, with reset remapped
to the INT pin:

i2c@12ca0000 {
	rtc@68 {
		compatible = "ds1374";
		reg = <0x68>;
		dallas,ds1374-mode = <2>
		dallas,ds1374-remap-wdt-reset;
	};
};
