Texas Instruments DS90Ux9xx de-/serializer controllers

Required properties:
- compatible: Must contain a generic "ti,ds90ux9xx" value and
	may contain one more specific value from the list:
	"ti,ds90ub925q",
	"ti,ds90uh925q",
	"ti,ds90ub927q",
	"ti,ds90uh927q",
	"ti,ds90ub926q",
	"ti,ds90uh926q",
	"ti,ds90ub928q",
	"ti,ds90uh928q",
	"ti,ds90ub940q",
	"ti,ds90uh940q".

Optional properties:
- reg : Specifies the I2C slave address of a local de-/serializer.
- power-gpios : GPIO line to control supplied power to the device.
- ti,backward-compatible-mode : Overrides backward compatibility mode.
	Possible values are "<1>" or "<0>".
	If "ti,backward-compatible-mode" is not mentioned, the backward
	compatibility mode is not touched and given by hardware pin strapping.
- ti,low-frequency-mode : Overrides low frequency mode.
	Possible values are "<1>" or "<0>".
	If "ti,low-frequency-mode" is not mentioned, the low frequency mode
	is not touched and given by hardware pin strapping.
- ti,video-map-select-msb: Sets video bridge pins to MSB mode, if it is set
	MAPSEL pin value is ignored.
- ti,video-map-select-lsb: Sets video bridge pins to LSB mode, if it is set
	MAPSEL pin value is ignored.
- ti,pixel-clock-edge : Selects Pixel Clock Edge.
	Possible values are "<1>" or "<0>".
	If "ti,pixel-clock-edge" is High <1>, output data is strobed on the
	Rising edge of the PCLK. If ti,pixel-clock-edge is Low <0>, data is
	strobed on the Falling edge of the PCLK.
	If "ti,pixel-clock-edge" is not mentioned, the pixel clock edge
	value is not touched and given by hardware pin strapping.
- ti,spread-spectrum-clock-generation : Spread Sprectrum Clock Generation.
	Possible values are from "<0>" to "<7>". The same value will be
	written to SSC register. If "ti,spread-spectrum-clock-gen" is not
	found, then SSCG will be disabled.

TI DS90Ux9xx serializers and deserializer device nodes may contain a number
of children device nodes to describe and enable particular subcomponents
found on ICs.

Example:

serializer: serializer@c {
	compatible = "ti,ds90ub927q", "ti,ds90ux9xx";
	reg = <0xc>;
	power-gpios = <&gpio5 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	ti,backward-compatible-mode = <0>;
	ti,low-frequency-mode = <0>;
	ti,pixel-clock-edge = <0>;
	...
}

deserializer: deserializer@3c {
	compatible = "ti,ds90ub940q", "ti,ds90ux9xx";
	reg = <0x3c>;
	power-gpios = <&gpio6 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	...
}
