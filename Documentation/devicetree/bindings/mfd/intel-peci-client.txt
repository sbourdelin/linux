* Intel PECI client bindings

PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) is a one-wire bus interface that
provides a communication channel from PECI clients in Intel processors and
chipset components to external monitoring or control devices. PECI is designed
to support the following sideband functions:

- Processor and DRAM thermal management
- Platform Manageability
- Processor Interface Tuning and Diagnostics
- Failure Analysis

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "intel,peci-client".
- reg        : Should contain address of a client CPU. According to the PECI
	       specification, client addresses start from 0x30.

Example:
	peci-bus@0 {
		compatible = "vendor,soc-peci";
		reg = <0x0 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		peci-client@30 {
			compatible = "intel,peci-client";
			reg = <0x30>;
		};

		peci-client@31 {
			compatible = "intel,peci-client";
			reg = <0x31>;
		};
	};
