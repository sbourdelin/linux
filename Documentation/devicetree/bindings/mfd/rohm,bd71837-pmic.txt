* ROHM BD71837 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD71837MWV is a programmable Power Management IC for powering single-core,
dual-core, and quad-core SoC’s such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is optimized for
low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. It integrates 8 Buck
egulators and 7 LDO’s to provide all the power rails required by the SoC and
the commonly used peripherals.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd71837".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators
			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd71837-regulator.txt
 - clock:		: Please see ../clock/rohm,bd71837-clock.txt

Optional properties:
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
			  BD71837MWV can report different power state change
			  events to other drivers. Different events can be seen
			  as separate BD71837 domain interrupts.
			  The BD71837 driver only provides the infrastructure
			  for the IRQs. The users should write own driver to
			  convert the IRQ into the event they wish. The IRQ can
			  be used with the standard
			  request_irq/enable_irq/disable_irq API inside the
			  kernel.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ should be 1.
			    The value in cell is the IRQ number.
			    Meaningfull numbers are:
			      0 => PMIC_STBY_REQ level change
			      1 => PMIC_ON_REQ level change
			      2 => WDOG_B level change
			      3 => Power Button level change
			      4 => Power Button Long Push
			      5 => Power Button Short Push
			      6 => SWRESET register is written 1

	pmic: pmic@4b {
		compatible = "rohm,bd71837";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x4b>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <29 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		interrupt-names = "irq";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <32768>;

		regulators {
			buck1: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "buck1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-ramp-delay = <1250>;
			};

		/* ... */
