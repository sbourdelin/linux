* ROHM BD71837 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD71837MWV is a programmable Power Management IC for powering single-core,
dual-core, and quad-core SoC’s such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is optimized for
low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. It integrates 8 Buck
egulators and 7 LDO’s to provide all the power rails required by the SoC and
the commonly used peripherals.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd71837".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 1 or 2.
			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
			    The second cell if present is the flags, encoded as trigger
			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators
			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd71837-regulator.txt
 - clock:		: Please see ../clock/rohm,bd71837-clock.txt

Example:

	pmic: bd71837@4b {
		compatible = "rohm,bd71837";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x4b>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <29 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		interrupt-names = "irq";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;

		regulators {
			compatible = "rohm,bd71837-pmic";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			buck1: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "buck1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-ramp-delay = <1250>;
			};
			...
		};
		clk: bd71837-32k-out {
			compatible = "rohm,bd71837-clk";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <32768>;
			clock-output-names = "bd71837-32k-out";
		};
	};
