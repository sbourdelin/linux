Cirrus Logic Madera class audio codecs multi-function device

These devices are audio SoCs with extensive digital capabilities and a range
of analogue I/O.

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of the following chip-specific strings:
        "cirrus,cs47l35"
        "cirrus,cs47l85"
        "cirrus,cs47l90"
        "cirrus,cs47l91"
        "cirrus,wm1840"

  - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number when
    using SPI.

  - DCVDD-supply : Power supply for the device as defined in
    bindings/regulator/regulator.txt
    Mandatory on CS47L35, CS47L90, CS47L91
    Optional on CS47L85, WM1840

  - AVDD-supply, DBVDD1-supply, DBVDD2-supply, CPVDD1-supply, CPVDD2-supply :
    Power supplies for the device

  - DBVDD3-supply, DBVDD4-supply : Power supplies for the device
    (CS47L85, CS47L90, CS47L91, WM1840)

  - SPKVDDL-supply, SPKVDDR-supply : Power supplies for the device
    (CS47L85, WM1840)

  - SPKVDD-supply : Power supply for the device
    (CS47L35)

Optional properties:

  - MICVDD-supply : Power supply, only need to be specified if
    powered externally

  - reset-gpios : One entry specifying the GPIO controlling /RESET.
    As defined in bindings/gpio.txt.
    Although optional, it is strongly recommended to use a hardware reset

  - MICBIASx : Initial data for the MICBIAS regulators, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
    One for each MICBIAS generator (MICBIAS1, MICBIAS2, ...)
    (all codecs)

    One for each output pin (MICBIAS1A, MIBCIAS1B, MICBIAS2A, ...)
    (all except CS47L85, WM1840)

    The following following additional property is supported for the generator
    nodes:
      - cirrus,ext-cap : Set to 1 if the MICBIAS has external decoupling
        capacitors attached.

Example:

codec: cs47l85@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l85";
	reg = <0>;

	reset-gpios = <&gpio 0>;

	MICBIAS1 {
		regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
		cirrus,ext-cap = <1>;
	};
};
