* I2C controller embedded in STMicroelectronics STM32 I2C platform

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be one of the following
  - "st,stm32f4-i2c"
  - "st,stm32f7-i2c"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Must contain the interrupt id for I2C event and then the
  interrupt id for I2C error.
- resets: Must contain the phandle to the reset controller.
- clocks: Must contain the input clock of the I2C instance.
- A pinctrl state named "default" must be defined to set pins in mode of
  operation for I2C transfer
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Optional properties :
- clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified,
  the default 100 kHz frequency will be used.
  For STM32F4 SoC Standard-mode and Fast-mode are supported, possible values are
  100000 and 400000.
  For STM32F7 SoC, Standard-mode, Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus are supported,
  possible values are 100000, 400000 and 1000000.
- st,i2c-timing : A 32-bit I2C timing refister value.
  This value is only required for "st,stm32f7-i2c".
  A specific external tool delivered by ST is used to compute the value to be
  set here according to i2C speed frequency, i2c clock source frequency,
  i2c rise time and i2c fall time inputs.
  - bit 31:28: PRESC[3:0]: Timing prescaler
  - bit 27:24: Reserved
  - bit 23:20: SCLDEL[3:0]: Data setup time
  - bit 19:16: SDADEL[3:0]: Data hold time
  - bit 15:8:  SCLH[7:0]: SCL high period
  - bit 7:0:   SCLL[7:0]: SCL low period

Example :

	i2c@40005400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32f4-i2c";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x40005400 0x400>;
		interrupts = <31>,
			     <32>;
		resets = <&rcc 277>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 149>;
		pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_sda_pin>, <&i2c1_scl_pin>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
	};
