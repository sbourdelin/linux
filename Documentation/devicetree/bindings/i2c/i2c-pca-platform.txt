* NXP PCA PCA9564/PCA9665 I2C controller

The PCA9564/PCA9665 serves as an interface between most standard
parallel-bus microcontrollers/microprocessors and the serial I2C-bus
and allows the parallel bus system to communicate bi-directionally
with the I2C-bus.

Required properties :

 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible : one of "nxp,pca9564" or "nxp,pca9665"

Optional properties
 - interrupts : the interrupt number
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller.
   If an interrupt is not specified polling will be used.
 - reset-gpios : gpio specifier for gpio connected to RESET_N pin.
 - clock-frequency : I2C bus frequency.
