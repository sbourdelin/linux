USB Connector
=============

USB connector node represents physical USB connector. It should be
a child of USB interface controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: describes type of the connector, must be one of:
    "usb-a-connector", "usb-b-connector", "usb-c-connector",

Optional properties:
- label: symbolic name for the connector
- type: size of the connector, should be specified in case of USB-A, USB-B
  non-standard (large) connector sizes: "mini", "micro"

Required nodes:
- any data bus to the connector should be modeled using the OF graph bindings
  specified in bindings/graph.txt, unless the bus is between parent node and
  the connector. Since single connector can have multpile data buses every bus
  has assigned OF graph port number as follows:
    0: High Speed (HS), present in all connectors,
    1: Super Speed (SS), present in SS capable connectors,
    2: Sideband use (SBU), present in USB-C,
    3: Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL), present in 11-pin Samsung micro-USB

Example
-------

muic_max77843@66 {
	...
	musb_con: connector {
		compatible = "usb-b-connector";
		label = "micro-USB";
		type = "micro";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@3 {
				reg = <3>;
				musb_con_mhl_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&mhl_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
};
