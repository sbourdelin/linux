USB Connector
=============

Required properties:
- compatible: "usb-connector"
  connectors with vendor specific extensions can add one of additional
  compatibles:
    "samsung,usb-connector-11pin": 11-pin Samsung micro-USB connector
- type: the USB connector type: "a", "b", "ab", "c"
- max-mode: max USB speed mode supported by the connector:
  "ls", "fs", "hs", "ss", "ss+"

Optional properties:
- label: a symbolic name for the connector
- size: size of the connector, should be specified in case of
  non-standard USB connectors: "mini", "micro", "powered"

Required nodes:
- any data bus to the connector should be modeled using the
  OF graph bindings specified in bindings/graph.txt.
  There should be exactly one port with at least one endpoint to
  different device nodes. The first endpoint (reg = <0>) should
  point to USB Interface Controller.

Example
-------

musb_con: connector {
	compatible = "samsung,usb-connector-11pin", "usb-connector";
	label = "usb";
	type = "b";
	size = "micro";
	max-mode = "hs";

	port {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		musb_con_usb_in: endpoint@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			remote-endpoint = <&muic_usb_out>;
		};

		musb_con_mhl_in: endpoint@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			remote-endpoint = <&mhl_out>;
		};
	};
};
