Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CPUFREQ Bindings

CPUFREQ FW is a hardware engine used by some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI)
SoCs to manage frequency in hardware. It is capable of controlling frequency
for multiple clusters.

Properties:
- compatible
	Usage:		required
	Value type:	<string>
	Definition:	must be "qcom,cpufreq-fw".

Note that #address-cells, #size-cells, and ranges shall be present to ensure
the cpufreq can address a freq-domain registers.

A freq-domain sub-node would be defined for the cpus with the following
properties:

- compatible:
	Usage:		required
	Value type:	<string>
	Definition:	must be "cpufreq".

- reg
	Usage:		required
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	Addresses and sizes for the memory of the perf_base
			, lut_base and en_base.
- reg-names
	Usage:		required
	Value type:	<stringlist>
	Definition:	Address names. Must be "perf_base", "lut_base",
			"en_base".
			Must be specified in the same order as the
			corresponding addresses are specified in the reg
			property.

- qcom,cpulist
	Usage:		required
	Value type:	<phandles of CPU>
	Definition:	List of related cpu handles which are under a cluster.

Example:
	qcom,cpufreq-fw {
		compatible = "qcom,cpufreq-fw";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		freq-domain-0 {
			compatible = "cpufreq";
			reg = <0x17d43920 0x4>,
			     <0x17d43110 0x500>,
			     <0x17d41000 0x4>;
			reg-names = "perf_base", "lut_base", "en_base";
			qcom,cpulist = <&CPU0 &CPU1 &CPU2 &CPU3>;
		};

		freq-domain-1 {
			compatible = "cpufreq";
			reg = <0x17d46120 0x4>,
			    <0x17d45910 0x500>,
			    <0x17d45800 0x4>;
			reg-names = "perf_base", "lut_base", "en_base";
			qcom,cpulist = <&CPU4 &CPU5 &CPU6 &CPU7>;
		};
	};
