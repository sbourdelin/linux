* Renesas RZ/N1 GPIO Interrupt Multiplexer

On Renesas RZ/N1 devices, there are several GPIO Controllers each with a number
of interrupt outputs. All of the interrupts from the GPIO Controllers are passed
to the GPIO Interrupt Multiplexer, which selects a sub-set of the interrupts to
pass onto the system interrupt controller.

A single node in the device tree is used to describe the GPIO IRQ Muxer.

Required properties:
- compatible: SoC-specific compatible string "renesas,<soc-specific>-gpioirqmux"
  followed by "renesas,rzn1-gpioirqmux" as fallback. The SoC-specific compatible
  strings must be one of:
	"renesas,r9a06g032-gpioirqmux" for RZ/N1D
	"renesas,r9a06g033-gpioirqmux" for RZ/N1S
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: should be <1>. The meaning of the cells is the input
   interrupt index, 0 to 95.
- reg: Base address and size of GPIO IRQ Muxer registers.
- interrupts: This is a list of interrupt specifiers. Each interrupt consists of
   three numbers that represent:
     - (a) the index of the GPIO Interrupt Multiplexer output interrupt (0..7)
     - (b) the index of the GPIO Controller input interrupt (0..2)
     - (c) the interrupt index of the GPIO Controller input interrupt (0..31).
- interrupt-parent: A phandle for a local node that specifies an interrupt-map.
   The interrupt-map node must specify #interrupt-cells = <3>, and an
   interrupt-map property. The interrupt-map is used to translate the interrupt
   specifier to the output interrupts. It is used in conjunction with an
   interrupt-map-mask property to mask (b) and (c) from the interrupt specifier
   so that essentially there is a direct map from (a) to the output interrupt.
   Therefore (b) and (c) can be used to determine the interrupt source and
   configure the hardware accordingly. For information on interrupts,
   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Example:

	The following is an example for the RZ/N1D SoC.

	gpioirqmux: gpioirqmux@51000480 {
		compatible = "renesas,r9a06g032-gpioirqmux",
				"renesas,rzn1-gpioirqmux";
		reg = <0x51000480 0x20>;

		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpioirqmux_map>;
		interrupts =
			<0 1 17>,	/* gpio1a 17 */
			<1 1 24>,	/* gpio1a 24 */
			<2 1 26>;	/* gpio1a 26 */

		gpioirqmux_map: gpioirqmux-map {
			#interrupt-cells = <3>;
			#address-cells = <0>;
			interrupt-map-mask = <7 0 0>;
			interrupt-map =
				<0 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<1 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 104 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<2 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 105 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<3 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 106 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<4 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 107 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<5 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 108 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<6 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 109 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				<7 0 0 &gic GIC_SPI 110 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		};
	};

	gpio1: gpio@5000c000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-gpio";
		reg = <0x5000c000 0x80>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clock-names = "bus";
		clocks = <&sysctrl R9A06G032_HCLK_GPIO1>;

		gpio1a: gpio-controller@0 {
			compatible = "snps,dw-apb-gpio-port";
			bank-name = "gpio1a";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			snps,nr-gpios = <32>;
			reg = <0>;

			interrupt-controller;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpioirqmux>;
			interrupts =   < 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
