BCM2835 Auxiliary ("AUXIRQ") Interrupt Controller

The BCM2835 family of SoCs multiplexes the interrupts for peripherals in
the AUX block into a single IRQ. The AUXIRQ register shows the IRQ status
of each of the peripherals. Note that there are no masking or clearing
facilities - interrupts must be enabled and acknowledged in the
individual peripherals.

Required properties:
- compatible :	     Should be "brcm,bcm2835-aux-intc".
- reg :		     Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts :	     The interrupt number - see
		     bindings/interrupt-controller/brcm,bcm2835-armctrl-ic.txt
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
		     interrupt source. The value shall be 1.

  The cell contains the interrupt specifier, as found in
  include/dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/bcm2835-aux-intc.h.

Example:

	auxintc: interrupt-controller@7e215000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-aux-intc";
		reg = <0x7e215000 0x4>;
		interrupts = <1 29>;
		interrupt-controller;
