Cirrus Logic Madera class audio codec IRQ driver

The IRQ properties are members of the parent MFD node.

See also the core bindings for the parent MFD driver:
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/madera.txt

Required properties:
  - interrupt-controller : Madera class devices contain interrupt controllers
    and may provide interrupt services to other devices.

  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to describe an IRQ, this should be 2.
    The first cell is the IRQ number.
    The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the /IRQ signal for the device is
    connected to.

  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Example:

codec: cs47l85@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l85";

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	interrupts = <&host_irq1>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
};
