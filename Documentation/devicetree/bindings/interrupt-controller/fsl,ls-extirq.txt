* Freescale Layerscape external IRQs

Some Layerscape SOCs (LS1021A, LS1043A, LS1046A) support inverting
the polarity of certain external interrupt lines.

The device node must be a child of the node representing the
Supplemental Configuration Unit (SCFG).

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,<soc-name>-extirq", e.g. "fsl,ls1021a-extirq".
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: Must be 2. The first element is the index of the
  external interrupt line. The second element is the trigger type.
- interrupt-parent: phandle of GIC.
- reg: Specifies the Interrupt Polarity Control Register (INTPCR) in the SCFG.
- fsl,extirq-map: Specifies the mapping to interrupt numbers in the parent
  interrupt controller. Interrupts are mapped one-to-one to parent
  interrupts.

Optional properties:
- fsl,bit-reverse: This boolean property should be set on the LS1021A
  if the SCFGREVCR register has been set to all-ones (which is usually
  the case), meaning that all reads and writes of SCFG registers are
  implicitly bit-reversed. Other compatible platforms do not have such
  a register.

Example:
	scfg: scfg@1570000 {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-scfg", "syscon";
		...
		extirq: interrupt-controller {
			compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-extirq";
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
			reg = <0x1ac>;
			fsl,extirq-map = <163 164 165 167 168 169>;
			fsl,bit-reverse;
		};
	};


	interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 88 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			      <&extirq 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
