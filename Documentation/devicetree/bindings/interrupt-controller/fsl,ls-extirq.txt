* Freescale Layerscape external IRQs

Some Layerscape SOCs (LS1021A, LS1043A, LS1046A) support inverting
the polarity of certain external interrupt lines.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,<soc-name>-extirq", e.g. "fsl,ls1021a-extirq".
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: Use the same format as specified by GIC in arm,gic.txt.
- interrupt-parent: phandle of GIC.
- syscon: phandle of Supplemental Configuration Unit (scfg) and offset
  to the INTPCR register.
- interrupts: Specifies the mapping to interrupt numbers in the parent
  interrupt controller. Interrupts are mapped one-to-one to parent
  interrupts.

Optional properties:
- bit-reverse: This boolean property should be set on the LS1021A if
  the SCFGREVCR register has been set to all-ones (which is usually
  the case), meaning that all reads and writes of SCFG registers are
  implicitly bit-reversed. Other compatible platforms do not have such
  a register.

Example:
	extirq: extirq {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1021a-extirq";
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		syscon = <&scfg 0x1ac>;
		interrupts = <163 164 165 167 168 169>;
		bit-reverse;
	};


	interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 88 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			      <&extirq GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
