Marvell SEI (System Error Interrupt) Controller
-----------------------------------------------

Marvell SEI (System Error Interrupt) controller is an interrupt
aggregator. It receives interrupts from several sources and aggregates
them to a single interrupt line (an SPI) on the parent interrupt
controller.

This interrupt controller can handle up to 64 SEIs, a set comes from the
AP and is wired while a second set comes from the CPs by the mean of
MSIs. Each 'domain' is represented as a subnode.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-8k-sei".
- reg: SEI registers location and length.
- interrupts: identifies the parent IRQ that will be triggered.

Child node 'sei-wired-controller' required properties:

- marvell,sei-ranges: ranges of wired interrupts.
- #interrupt-cells: number of cells to define an SEI wired interrupt
                    coming from the AP, should be 1. The cell is the IRQ
                    number.
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller.

Child node 'sei-msi-controller' required properties:

- marvell,sei-ranges: ranges of non-wired interrupts triggered by way of
                      MSIs.
- msi-controller: identifies the node as an MSI controller.

Example:

        sei: sei@3f0200 {
               compatible = "marvell,armada-8k-sei";
               reg = <0x3f0200 0x40>;
               interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

               sei_wired_controller: sei-wired-controller@0 {
                       marvell,sei-ranges = <0 21>;
                       #interrupt-cells = <1>;
                       interrupt-controller;
               };

               sei_msi_controller: sei-msi-controller@21 {
                       marvell,sei-ranges = <21 43>;
                       msi-controller;
               };
       };
