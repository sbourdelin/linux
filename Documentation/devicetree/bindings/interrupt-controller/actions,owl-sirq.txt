Actions Semi Owl SoCs SIRQ interrupt controller

S500, S700 and S900 SoC's from Actions provides 3 SPI's from GIC,
in which external interrupt controller can be connected. 3 SPI's
45, 46, 47 from GIC are directly exposed as SIRQ. It has
the following properties:

- inputs three interrupt signal from external interrupt controller

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "actions,owl-sirq"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped.
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
  source, should be 2.
- actions,sirq-shared-reg: Applicable for S500 and S700 where SIRQ register
  details are maintained at same offset/register.
- actions,sirq-offset: register offset for SIRQ interrupts. When registers are
  shared, all the three offsets will be same (S500 and S700).
- actions,sirq-clk-sel: external interrupt controller can be either
  connected to 32Khz or 24Mhz external/internal clock. This needs
  to be configured for per SIRQ line. Failing defaults to 32Khz clock.

Example for S900:

sirq: interrupt-controller@e01b0000 {
	compatible = "actions,owl-sirq";
	reg = <0 0xe01b0000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	actions,sirq-clk-sel = <0 0 0>;
	actions,sirq-offset = <0x200 0x528 0x52c>;
};

Example for S500 and S700:

sirq: interrupt-controller@e01b0000 {
	compatible = "actions,owl-sirq";
	reg = <0 0xe01b0000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	actions,sirq-shared-reg;
	actions,sirq-clk-sel = <0 0 0>;
	actions,sirq-offset = <0x200 0x200 0x200>;
};
