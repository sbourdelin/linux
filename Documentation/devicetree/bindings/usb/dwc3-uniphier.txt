UniPhier DWC3 glue layer

This describes the devicetree bindings for dwc3-uniphier driver implemented on
Socionext UniPhier SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible:
  - "socionext,uniphier-pxs2-dwc3" : For UniPhier PXs2 SoC
  - "socionext,uniphier-ld20-dwc3" : For UniPhier LD20 SoC
- reg: Address and range of the glue logic
- clocks: List of phandles for the clocks, and the number of phandles depends
	  on SoC platform.

Optional properties:
- resets: List of phandles for the resets, and the number of phandles depends
	on SoC platform.
- nvmem-cells: Phandles to nvmem cell that contains the trimming data.
	Available only for LD20, and if unspecified, default value is used.
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be the following names, which correspond to each
	nvmem-cells. N is the number indicating a port of phy.
	All of the 3 parameters associated with the following names are
	required for each port, if any one is omitted, the trimming data
	of the port will not be set at all.
	- "rtermN", "sel_tN", "hs_iN" : Each cell name for phy parameters

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Example:

	usb: usb@65b00000 {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-ld20-dwc3";
		reg = <0x65b00000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&sys_clk 14>, <&sys_clk 16>, <&sys_clk 17>;
		resets = <&sys_rst 12>, <&sys_rst 16>, <&sys_rst 17>,
			 <&sys_rst 18>, <&sys_rst 19>;
		nvmem-cells = <&usb_rterm0>, <&usb_rterm1>,
			      <&usb_rterm2>, <&usb_rterm3>,
			      <&usb_sel_t0>, <&usb_sel_t1>,
			      <&usb_sel_t2>, <&usb_sel_t3>,
			      <&usb_hs_i0>,  <&usb_hs_i0>,
			      <&usb_hs_i2>,  <&usb_hs_i2>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "rterm0", "rterm1", "rterm2", "rterm3",
				   "sel_t0", "sel_t1", "sel_t2", "sel_t3",
				   "hs_i0",  "hs_i1",  "hs_i2",  "hs_i3";
		ranges;

		dwc3@65a00000 {
			compatible = "snps,dwc3";
			reg = <0x65a00000 0xcd00>;
			interrupt-names = "host";
			interrupts = <0 134 4>;
			dr_mode = "host";
		};
	};
