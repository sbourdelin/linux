Broadcom USB Device Controller (BDC)
====================================

Required properties:

- compatible: must be one of:
                "brcm,bdc-udc-v0.16"
                "brcm,bdc-udc"
- reg: the base register address and length
- interrupts: ther interrupt line for this controller

Optional properties:

On Broadcom STB platforms, these properties are required:

- phys: phandle to the USB PHY blocks
- clocks: phandle to the functional clock of this block

Example:

        udc@f0b02000 {
                status = "disabled";
                compatible = "brcm,bdc-udc-v0.16";
                reg = <0xf0b02000 0xfc4>;
                interrupts = <0x0 0x60 0x0>;
                phys = <&usbphy_0 0x0>;
                clocks = <&sw_usbd>;
        };
