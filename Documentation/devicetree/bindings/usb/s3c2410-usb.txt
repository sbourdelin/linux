Samsung S3C2410 and compatible SoC USB controller

OHCI

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "samsung,s3c2410-ohci" for USB host controller
 - reg: address and lenght of the controller memory mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt number for the USB OHCI controller
 - clocks: Should reference the bus and host clocks
 - clock-names: Should contain two strings
		"usb-bus-host" for the USB bus clock
		"usb-host" for the USB host clock

Example:

usb0: ohci@49000000 {
	compatible = "samsung,s3c2410-ohci";
	reg = <0x49000000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0 0 26 3>;
	clocks = <&clocks UCLK>, <&clocks HCLK_USBH>;
	clock-names = "usb-bus-host", "usb-host";
};

Samsung S3C2410 and compatible USB device controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	       "samsung,s3c2410-udc"
	       "samsung,s3c2440-udc"
 - reg: address and length of the controller memory mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt number for the USB device controller
 - clocks: Should reference the bus and host clocks
 - clock-names: Should contain two strings
		"usb-bus-gadget" for the USB bus clock
		"usb-device" for the USB device clock

Optional properties:
 - samsung,vbus-gpio: If present, specifies a gpio that needs to be
   activated for the bus to be powered.
