Generic USB root-hub Properties

similar to the USB device bindings (documented in usb-device.txt from the
current directory) this provides support for configuring the root-hub.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be at least one of "usb1d6b,3", "usb1d6b,2"
- reg: must be 0.
- address-cells: must be 1
- size-cells: must be 0

Required sub-nodes:
a sub-node per actual USB port is required. each sub-node supports the
following properties:
  Required properties:
    - reg: the port number on the root-hub (mandatory)
  Optional properties:
    - phys: optional, from the *Generic PHY* bindings (mandatory needed
      when phy-names is given)
    - phy-names: optional, from the *Generic PHY* bindings; supported names
      are "usb2-phy" or "usb3-phy"

Example:
	&usb1 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		roothub@0 {
			compatible = "usb1d6b,3", "usb1d6b,2";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				phys = <&usb2_phy1>, <&usb3_phy1>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
			};

			port@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				phys = <&usb2_phy2>, <&usb3_phy2>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
			};
		};
	}
