PXA25x UDC (USB Device Controller)

The PXA25x and IXP4xx USB Device Controller is different from the
PXA27x UDC described in pxa-usb.txt and is compatible between the
Marvell PXA25x and the Intel IXP4xx devices.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of
   "marvell,pxa25x-udc"
   "intel,ixp4xx-udc"
   for USB controllers used in device mode.
 - reg: usb device MMIO address space
 - interrupts: single interrupt generated by the UDC IP
 - clocks: input clock of the UDC IP (see clock-bindings.txt)

Optional properties:
 - gpios:
   - gpio activated to control the USB D+ pullup (see gpio.txt)

Example:

usb@c800b000 {
	compatible = "intel,ixp4xx-udc";
	reg = <0xc800b000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&pclk 0>;
};
