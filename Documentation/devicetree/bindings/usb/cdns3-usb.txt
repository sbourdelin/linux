Binding for the Cadence USBSS-DRD controller

Required properties:
  - reg: Physical base address and size of the controller's register areas.
	 Controller has 3 different regions:
	 region 1 - HOST registers area
	 region 2 - DEVICE registers area
	 region 3 - OTG/DRD registers area
  - compatible: Should contain: "cdns,usb3"
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier. Refer to interrupt bindings.
		Driver supports only single interrupt line.
                This single interrupt is shared between Device,
		host and OTG/DRD part of driver.

Optional propertiesi:
 - maximum-speed : valid arguments are "super-speed", "high-speed" and
                   "full-speed"; refer to usb/generic.txt
 - dr_mode: Should be one of "host", "peripheral" or "otg".
 - phys: reference to the USB PHY
 - phy-names: name of the USB PHY, should be "cdns3,usbphy"


Example:
	usb@f3000000 {
		compatible = "cdns,usb3";
		interrupts = <USB_IRQ  7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0xf3000000 0x10000	//memory area for HOST registers
			0xf3010000 0x10000	//memory area for DEVICE registers
			0xf3020000 0x10000>;	//memory area for OTG/DRD registers
	};
