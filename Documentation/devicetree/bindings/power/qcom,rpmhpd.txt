Qualcomm RPMh Power domains

For RPMh Power domains, we communicate a performance state to RPMh
which then translates it into a corresponding voltage on a rail

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	* qcom,sdm845-rpmhpd: RPMh Power domain for the sdm845 family of SoC
 - power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier
	must be 1
 - operating-points-v2: Phandle to the OPP table for the power-domain.
	Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt
	and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/qcom-opp.txt for more details

Example:

	rpmhpd: power-controller {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-rpmhpd";
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		operating-points-v2 = <&rpmhpd_opp_table>;
	};

	rpmhpd_opp_table: opp-table {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2-qcom-level";

		rpmhpd_opp_ret: opp1 {
			qcom-level = <16>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_min_svs: opp2 {
			qcom-level = <48>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_low_svs: opp3 {
			qcom-level = <64>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_svs: opp4 {
			qcom-level = <128>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_svs_l1: opp5 {
			qcom-level = <192>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_nom: opp6 {
			qcom-level = <256>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_nom_l1: opp7 {
			qcom-level = <320>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_nom_l2: opp8 {
			qcom-level = <336>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_turbo: opp9 {
			qcom-level = <384>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp_turbo_l1: opp10 {
			qcom-level = <416>;
		};
	};
