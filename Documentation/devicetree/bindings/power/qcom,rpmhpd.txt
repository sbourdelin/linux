Qualcomm RPMh Powerdomains

* For RPMh powerdomains, we communicate a performance state to RPMh
which then translates it into a corresponding voltage on a rail

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	* qcom,sdm845-rpmhpd: RPMh powerdomain for the sdm845 family of SoC
 - power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier
	must be 1
 - operating-points-v2: Phandle to the OPP table for the power-domain.
	Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt
	and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/qcom-opp.txt for more details

Example:

	rpmhpd: power-controller {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-rpmhpd";
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		operating-points-v2 = <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>,
				      <&rpmhpd_opp_table>;
	};

	rpmhpd_opp_table: opp-table {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2-qcom-level", "operating-points-v2";

		rpmhpd_opp1: opp@1 {
			qcom-corner = <16>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp2: opp@2 {
			qcom-corner = <48>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp3: opp@3 {
			qcom-corner = <64>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp4: opp@4 {
			qcom-corner = <128>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp5: opp@5 {
			qcom-corner = <192>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp6: opp@6 {
			qcom-corner = <256>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp7: opp@7 {
			qcom-corner = <320>;
		};

		rpmhpd_opp8: opp@8 {
			qcom-corner = <416>;
		};
	};
