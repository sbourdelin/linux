Qualcomm RPM Power domains

For RPM Power domains, we communicate a performance state to RPM
which then translates it into a corresponding voltage on a rail

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	* qcom,msm8996-rpmpd: RPM Power domain for the msm8996 family of SoC
 - power-domain-cells: number of cells in Power domain specifier
	must be 1.
 - operating-points-v2: Phandle to the OPP table for the Power domain.
	Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt
	and Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/qcom-opp.txt for more details

Example:

	rpmpd: power-controller {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-rpmpd";
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		operating-points-v2 = <&rpmpd_opp_table>;
	};

	rpmpd_opp_table: opp-table {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2-qcom-level";

		rpmpd_opp1: opp1 {
			qcom,level = <1>;
		};

		rpmpd_opp2: opp2 {
			qcom,level = <2>;
		};

		rpmpd_opp3: opp3 {
			qcom,level = <3>;
		};

		rpmpd_opp4: opp4 {
			qcom,level = <4>;
		};

		rpmpd_opp5: opp5 {
			qcom,level = <5>;
		};

		rpmpd_opp6: opp6 {
			qcom,level = <6>;
		};
	};
