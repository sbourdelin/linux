Battery Characteristics

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Must be "fixed-battery"

Optional Properties:
 - voltage-min-design-microvolt: drained battery voltage
 - energy-full-design-microwatt-hours: battery design energy
 - charge-full-design-microamp-hours: battery design capacity

Future Properties must be named for the corresponding elements in
enum power_supply_property, defined in include/linux/power_supply.h.

Batteries must be referenced by chargers and/or fuel-gauges
using a phandle. The phandle's property should be named
"monitored-battery".

Example:

	bat: battery {
		compatible = "fixed-battery";
		voltage-min-design-microvolt = <3200000>;
		energy-full-design-microwatt-hours = <5290000>;
		charge-full-design-microamp-hours = <1430000>;
	};

	charger: charger@11 {
		....
		monitored-battery = <&bat>;
		...
	};

	fuel_gauge: fuel-gauge@22 {
		....
		monitored-battery = <&bat>;
		...
	};
