Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. FastRPC Driver

The FastRPC driver implements an IPC (Inter-Processor Communication)
mechanism that allows for clients to transparently make remote method
invocations across DSP and APPS boundaries. This enables developers
to offload tasks to the DSP and free up the application processor for
other tasks.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,fastrpc"

- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: DSP Processor ID.
	Possible values are :
			0 - ADSP
			1 - MDSP
			2 - SDSP
			3 - CDSP

= COMPUTE BANKS
Each subnode of the Fastrpc node represents compute context banks avaiable
on the dsp. The name of the nodes are not important. The properties of these
nodes are defined by the individual bindings for the specific service
- All Compute context banks MUST contain the following property:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,fastrpc-compute-cb"

- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Context Bank ID.

- secured:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <boolean>
	Defination: Indicating context bank is secured

- nsessions:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Defination: A value indicating how many sessions can share this
		    context bank. Defaults to 'One' when this property
		    is not specified.

Example:

fastrpc {
	compatible = "qcom,fastrpc";
	qcom,smd-channels = "fastrpcsmd-apps-dsp";
	reg = <0>; /* DOMAIN_ADSP */
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	cb@1 {
		compatible = "qcom,fastrpc-compute-cb";
		reg = <1>;
		iommus = <&lpass_q6_smmu 1>;
	};

	cb@2 {
		compatible = "qcom,fastrpc-compute-cb";
		reg = <2>;
		iommus = <&lpass_q6_smmu 2>;
	};
	...
};
