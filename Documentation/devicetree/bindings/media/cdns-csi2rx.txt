Cadence CSI2RX controller
=========================

The Cadence CSI2RX controller is a CSI-2 bridge supporting up to 4 CSI
lanes in input, and 4 different pixel streams in output.

Required properties:
  - compatible: must be set to "cdns,csi2rx"
  - reg: base address and size of the memory mapped region
  - clocks: phandles to the clocks driving the controller
  - clock-names: must contain:
    * sys_clk: main clock
    * p_clk: register bank clock
    * p_free_clk: free running register bank clock
    * pixel_ifX_clk: pixel stream output clock, one for each stream
                     implemented in hardware, between 0 and 3
    * dphy_rx_clk: D-PHY byte clock, if implemented in hardware
  - phys: phandle to the external D-PHY
  - phy-names: must contain dphy, if the implementation uses an
               external D-PHY

Required subnodes:
  - ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in
           Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The
           first port subnode should be the input endpoint, the second one the
           outputs

  The output port should have as many endpoints as stream supported by
  the hardware implementation, between 1 and 4, their ID being the
  stream output number used in the implementation.

Example:

csi2rx: csi-bridge@0d060000 {
	compatible = "cdns,csi2rx";
	reg = <0x0d060000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&byteclock>, <&byteclock>, <&byteclock>,
		 <&coreclock>, <&coreclock>,
		 <&coreclock>, <&coreclock>;
	clock-names = "sys_clk", "p_clk", "p_free_clk",
		      "pixel_if0_clk", "pixel_if1_clk",
		      "pixel_if2_clk", "pixel_if3_clk";

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			csi2rx_in_sensor: endpoint@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				remote-endpoint = <&sensor_out_csi2rx>;
				clock-lanes = <0>;
				data-lanes = <1 2>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <1>;

			csi2rx_out_grabber0: endpoint@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				remote-endpoint = <&grabber0_in_csi2rx>;
			};

			csi2rx_out_grabber1: endpoint@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				remote-endpoint = <&grabber1_in_csi2rx>;
			};

			csi2rx_out_grabber2: endpoint@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				remote-endpoint = <&grabber2_in_csi2rx>;
			};

			csi2rx_out_grabber3: endpoint@3 {
				reg = <3>;
				remote-endpoint = <&grabber3_in_csi2rx>;
			};
		};
	};
};
