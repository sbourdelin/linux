* Toshiba TC358746 Parallel to MIPI CSI2-TX or MIPI CSI2-RX to Parallel Bridge

The Toshiba TC358746 is a bridge that converts a Parallel-in stream to MIPI CSI-2 TX
or a MIPI CSI-2 RX stream into a Parallel-out. It is programmable through I2C.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "toshiba,tc358746"
- reg: should be <0x0e>
- clocks: should contain a phandle link to the reference clock source
- clock-names: the clock input is named "refclk".

Optional Properties:

- reset-gpios: gpio phandle GPIO connected to the reset pin

Parallel Endpoint:

Required Properties:

- reg: should be <0>
- bus-width: the data bus width e.g. <8> for eight bit bus, or <16>
	     for sixteen bit wide bus.

MIPI CSI-2 Endpoint:

Required Properties:

- reg: should be <1>
- data-lanes: should be <1 2 3 4> for four-lane operation,
	      or <1 2> for two-lane operation
- clock-lanes: should be <0>
- link-frequencies: List of allowed link frequencies in Hz. Each frequency is
		    expressed as a 64-bit big-endian integer. The frequency
		    is half of the bps per lane due to DDR transmission.

Optional Properties:

- clock-noncontinuous: Presence of this boolean property decides whether the
		       MIPI CSI-2 clock is continuous or non-continuous.

For further information on the endpoint node properties, see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c {
	tc358746: tc358746@0e {
		reg = <0x0e>;
		compatible = "toshiba,tc358746";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		clocks = <&clk_cam_ref>;
		clock-names = "refclk";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio3 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			tc358746_parallel_in: endpoint {
				bus-width = <8>;
				remote-endpoint = <&micron_parallel_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			tc358746_mipi2_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_csi2_in>;
				data-lanes = <1 2>;
				clock-lanes = <0>;
				clock-noncontinuous;
				link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <216000000>;
			};
		};
	};
};
