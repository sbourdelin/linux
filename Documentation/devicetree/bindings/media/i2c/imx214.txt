* Sony 1/3.06-Inch 13.13Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Sony imx214 is a 1/3.06-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 4224H x 3176V. It is programmable through I2C
interface. The I2C address can be configured to to 0x1a or 0x10, depending on
how is wired.
Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes
at 1440 Mbps.


Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "sony,imx214" for imx214 sensor
- reg: I2C bus address of the device
- enable-gpios: Sensor enable GPIO
- vdddo-supply: Chip digital IO regulator (1.8V).
- vdda-supply: Chip analog regulator (2.7V).
- vddd-supply: Chip digital core regulator (1.12V).
- clocks = Reference to the xclk clock.
- clock-names = Should be "xclk".
- clock-frequency = Frequency of the xclk clock. Should be <24000000>;

Optional Properties:
- flash-leds: See ../video-interfaces.txt
- lens-focus: See ../video-interfaces.txt

The imx274 device node should contain one 'port' child node with
an 'endpoint' subnode. For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	camera_rear@1a {
		status = "okay";
		compatible = "sony,imx214";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		vdddo-supply = <&pm8994_lvs1>;
		vddd-supply = <&camera_vddd_1v12>;
		vdda-supply = <&pm8994_l17>;
		lens-focus = <&ad5820>;
		enable-gpios = <&msmgpio 25 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mmcc CAMSS_MCLK0_CLK>;
		clock-names = "xclk";
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		port {
				imx214_ep: endpoint {
				clock-lanes = <1>;
				data-lanes = <0 2 3 4>;
				remote-endpoint = <&csiphy0_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
