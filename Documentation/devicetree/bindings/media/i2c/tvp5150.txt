* Texas Instruments TVP5150 and TVP5151 video decoders

The TVP5150 and TVP5151 are video decoders that convert baseband NTSC and PAL
(and also SECAM in the TVP5151 case) video signals to either 8-bit 4:2:2 YUV
with discrete syncs or 8-bit ITU-R BT.656 with embedded syncs output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value must be "ti,tvp5150"
- reg: I2C slave address

Optional Properties:
- pdn-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the PDN pin, if any.
- reset-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the RESETB pin, if any.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Required Endpoint Properties for parallel synchronization:

- hsync-active: active state of the HSYNC signal. Must be <1> (HIGH).
- vsync-active: active state of the VSYNC signal. Must be <1> (HIGH).
- field-even-active: field signal level during the even field data
  transmission. Must be <0>.

If none of hsync-active, vsync-active and field-even-active is specified,
the endpoint is assumed to use embedded BT.656 synchronization.

-Optional nodes:
- connectors: The list of tvp5150 input connectors available on a given
  board. The node should contain a child 'port' node for each connector.

  The tvp5150 has support for three possible connectors: 2 Composite and
  1 S-video. The "reg" property is used to specify which input connector
  is associated with each 'port', using the following possible values:

  0: Composite0
  1: Composite1
  2: S-Video

  The ports should have an endpoint subnode that is linked to a connector
  node defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/connector/.
  The linked connector compatible string should match the connector type.

Example:

composite0: connector@0 {
	compatible = "composite-video-connector";
	label = "Composite0";

	port {
		comp0_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&tvp5150_comp0_in>;
		};
	};
};

svideo: connector@1 {
	compatible = "composite-video-connector";
	label = "S-Video";

	port {
		svideo_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&tvp5150_svideo_in>;
		};
	};
};

&i2c2 {
	...
	tvp5150@5c {
		compatible = "ti,tvp5150";
		reg = <0x5c>;
		pdn-gpios = <&gpio4 30 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio6 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		connectors {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			/* Composite0 input */
			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				tvp5150_comp0_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&comp0_out>;
				};
			};

			/* S-Video input */
			port@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				tvp5150_svideo_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&svideo_out>;
				};
			};
		};

		port {
			tvp5150_1: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ccdc_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
};
