IMI D&D RDACM20 Automotive Camera Platform
------------------------------------------

The IMI D&D RDACM20 is a GMSL-compatible camera designed for automotive
applications. It encloses a Maxim Integrated MAX9271 GMSL serializer, an
Omnivision OV10635 camera sensor and an embedded MCU, and connects to a remote
GMSL endpoint through a coaxial cable.

The RDACM20 transmits video data generated by the embedded camera sensor on the
GMSL serial channel to a remote GMSL de-serializer, as well as it receives and
transmits I2C messages encapsulated in the GMSL bidirectional control channel.

All I2C traffic received on the GMSL link not directed to the serializer is
propagated on the local I2C bus to the embedded camera sensor and MCU. All
I2C traffic generated on the local I2C bus not directed to the serializer is
propagated to the remote de-serializer encapsulated in the GMSL control channel.

The RDACM20 DT node should be a direct child of the GMSL Deserializer's I2C bus
corresponding to the GMSL link that the camera is attached to.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Shall be "imi,rdacm20".
- reg: Pair of I2C device addresses, the first to be assigned to the serializer
  the second to be assigned to the camera sensor.

Connection to the remote GMSL endpoint are modelled using the OF graph bindings
in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

The device node contains a single "port" child node with a single "endpoint"
sub-device.

Required endpoint properties:

- remote-endpoint: phandle to the remote GMSL endpoint sub-node in the remote
  node port.

Example:
-------

	i2c@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0>;

		camera@51 {
			compatible = "imi,rdacm20";
			reg = <0x51 0x61>;

			port {
				rdacm20_out0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&max9286_in0>;
				};
			};

		};
	};
