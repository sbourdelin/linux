* Omnivision OV7740 CMOS image sensor

The Omnivision OV7740 image sensor supports multiple output image
size, such as VGA, and QVGA, CIF and any size smaller. It also
supports the RAW RGB and YUV output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "ovti,ov7740"
- clocks: reference to the xvclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xvclk".

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the reset_b pin,
  if any. Active low with pull-ip resistor.
- powerdown-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the pwdn pin,
  if any. Active high with pull-down resistor.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital
output video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings
defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c1: i2c@fc028000 {
		ov7740: camera@21 {
			compatible = "ovti,ov7740";
			reg = <0x21>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_sensor_power &pinctrl_sensor_reset>;
			clocks = <&isc>;
			clock-names = "xvclk";
			assigned-clocks = <&isc>;
			assigned-clock-rates = <24000000>;
			reset-gpios = <&pioA 43 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			powerdown-gpios = <&pioA 44 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

			port {
				ov7740_0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&isc_0>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
