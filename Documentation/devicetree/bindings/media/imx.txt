Freescale i.MX Media Video Device
=================================

Video Media Controller node
---------------------------

This is the media controller node for video capture support. It is a
virtual device that lists the camera serial interface nodes that the
media device will control.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,imx-capture-subsystem";
- ports      : Should contain a list of phandles pointing to camera
		sensor interface ports of IPU devices

example:

capture-subsystem {
	compatible = "fsl,capture-subsystem";
	ports = <&ipu1_csi0>, <&ipu1_csi1>;
};

fim child node
--------------

This is an optional child node of the ipu_csi port nodes. If present and
available, it enables the Frame Interval Monitor. Its properties can be
used to modify the method in which the FIM measures frame intervals.
Refer to Documentation/media/v4l-drivers/imx.rst for more info on the
Frame Interval Monitor.

Optional properties:
- fsl,input-capture-channel: an input capture channel and channel flags,
			     specified as <chan flags>. The channel number
			     must be 0 or 1. The flags can be
			     IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING, or
			     IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH, and specify which input
			     capture signal edge will trigger the input
			     capture event. If an input capture channel is
			     specified, the FIM will use this method to
			     measure frame intervals instead of via the EOF
			     interrupt. The input capture method is much
			     preferred over EOF as it is not subject to
			     interrupt latency errors. However it requires
			     routing the VSYNC or FIELD output signals of
			     the camera sensor to one of the i.MX input
			     capture pads (SD1_DAT0, SD1_DAT1), which also
			     gives up support for SD1.


mipi_csi2 node
--------------

This is the device node for the MIPI CSI-2 Receiver, required for MIPI
CSI-2 sensors.

Required properties:
- compatible	: "fsl,imx6-mipi-csi2", "snps,dw-mipi-csi2";
- reg           : physical base address and length of the register set;
- clocks	: the MIPI CSI-2 receiver requires three clocks: hsi_tx
                  (the DPHY clock), video_27m, and eim_podf;
- clock-names	: must contain "dphy", "cfg", "pix";

Optional properties:
- interrupts	: must contain two level-triggered interrupts,
                  in order: 100 and 101;
