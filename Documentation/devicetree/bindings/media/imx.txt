Freescale i.MX Media Video Device
=================================

Video Media Controller node
---------------------------

This is the media controller node for video capture support. It is a
virtual device that lists the camera serial interface nodes that the
media device will control.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,imx-capture-subsystem";
- ports      : Should contain a list of phandles pointing to camera
		sensor interface ports of IPU devices

example:

capture-subsystem {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-capture-subsystem";
	ports = <&ipu1_csi0>, <&ipu1_csi1>;
};


mipi_csi2 node
--------------

This is the device node for the MIPI CSI-2 Receiver, required for MIPI
CSI-2 sensors.

Required properties:
- compatible	: "fsl,imx6-mipi-csi2", "snps,dw-mipi-csi2";
- reg           : physical base address and length of the register set;
- clocks	: the MIPI CSI-2 receiver requires three clocks: hsi_tx
		  (the D-PHY clock), video_27m (D-PHY PLL reference
		  clock), and eim_podf;
- clock-names	: must contain "dphy", "ref", "pix";
- port@*        : five port nodes must exist, containing endpoints
		  connecting to the source and sink devices according to
		  of_graph bindings. The first port is an input port,
		  connecting with a MIPI CSI-2 source, and ports 1
		  through 4 are output ports connecting with parallel
		  bus sink endpoint nodes and correspond to the four
		  MIPI CSI-2 virtual channel outputs.

Optional properties:
- interrupts	: must contain two level-triggered interrupts,
		  in order: 100 and 101;
