Renesas Capture Engine Unit (CEU)
----------------------------------------------

The Capture Engine Unit is the image capture interface found on Renesas
RZ chip series and on SH Mobile ones.

The interface supports a single parallel input with data bus width up to
8/16 bits.

Required properties:
- compatible
	Must be one of:
	- "renesas,ceu"
	- "renesas,r7s72100-ceu"
- reg
	Physical address base and size.
- interrupts
	The interrupt specifier.
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0
	phandle of pin controller sub-node configuring pins for CEU operations.
- remote-endpoint
	phandle to an 'endpoint' subnode of a remote device node.

CEU supports a single parallel input and should contain a single 'port' subnode
with a single 'endpoint'. Optional endpoint properties applicable to parallel
input bus described in "video-interfaces.txt" supported by this driver are:

- hsync-active
	active state of the HSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.
- vsync-active
	active state of the VSYNC signal, 0/1 for LOW/HIGH respectively.

Example:

The example describes the connection between the Capture Engine Unit and an
OV7670 image sensor sitting on bus i2c1.

ceu: ceu@e8210000 {
	reg = <0xe8210000 0x209c>;
	compatible = "renesas,ceu";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 332 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&vio_pins>;

	status = "okay";

	port {
		ceu_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ov7670_out>;

			hsync-active = <1>;
			vsync-active = <0>;
		};
	};
};

i2c1: i2c@fcfee400 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_pins>;

	status = "okay";

	clock-frequency = <100000>;

	ov7670: camera@21 {
		compatible = "ovti,ov7670";
		reg = <0x21>;

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&vio_pins>;

		reset-gpios = <&port3 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		powerdown-gpios = <&port3 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		port {
			ov7670_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ceu_in>;

				hsync-active = <1>;
				vsync-active = <0>;
			};
		};
	};
};
