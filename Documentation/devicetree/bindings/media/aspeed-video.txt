* Device tree bindings for Aspeed Video Engine

The Video Engine (VE) embedded in the Aspeed AST2400 and AST2500 SOCs can
capture and compress video data from digital or analog sources.

Required properties:
 - compatible:		"aspeed,ast2400-video" or "aspeed,ast2500-video"
 - reg:			contains the offset and length of the VE memory region
 - clocks:		pointers to the the "vclk" and "eclk" of the syscon
 - clock-names:		"vclk-gate", "eclk-gate"
 - resets:		pointer to the VE reset of the syscon
 - interrupts:		the interrupt associated with the VE on this platform
 - reg-scu:		pointer to the syscon itself

Example:

video: video@1e700000 {
        compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-video";
        reg = <0x1e700000 0x20000>;
        clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_VCLK>, <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_ECLK>;
        clock-names = "vclk-gate", "eclk-gate";
        resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_VIDEO>;
        interrupts = <7>;
        reg-scu = <&syscon>;
};
