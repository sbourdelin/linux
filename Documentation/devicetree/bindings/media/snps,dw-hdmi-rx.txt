Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder
===================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
RX Decoder (DWC HDMI RX). It doesn't constitute a device tree binding
specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
device tree bindings.

When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
this document are defined as follows.

- compatible: Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-rx".

- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC HDMI RX registers.

- interrupts: Reference to the DWC HDMI RX interrupt and 5v sense interrupt.

- clocks: Phandle to the config clock block.

- clock-names: Shall be "cfg".

- edid-phandle: phandle to the EDID handler block.

- #address-cells: Shall be 1.

- #size-cells: Shall be 0.

You also have to create a subnode for phy driver. Phy properties are as follows.

- compatible: Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405".

- reg: Shall be JTAG address of phy.

- clocks: Phandle for cfg clock.

- clock-names:Shall be "cfg".

A sample binding is now provided. The compatible string is for a SoC which has
has a Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX decoder inside.

Example:

dw_hdmi_soc: dw-hdmi-soc@0 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-soc";
	reg = <0x11c00 0x1000>; /* EDIDs */
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	hdmi-rx@0 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-rx";
		reg = <0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <1 2>;
		edid-phandle = <&dw_hdmi_soc>;

		clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
		clock-names = "cfg";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		hdmi-phy@fc {
			compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405";
			reg = <0xfc>;

			clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
			clock-names = "cfg";
		};
	};
};
