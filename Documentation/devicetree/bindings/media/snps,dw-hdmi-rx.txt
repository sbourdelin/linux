Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder
===================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
RX Decoder (DWC HDMI RX). It doesn't constitute a device tree binding
specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
device tree bindings.

The properties bellow belong to the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder node.

- compatible: Required property. Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-rx".

- reg: Required property. Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC
HDMI RX registers.

- interrupts: Required property. Reference to the DWC HDMI RX interrupt and
HDMI 5V sense interrupt.

- clocks: Required property. Phandle to the config clock block.

- clock-names: Required property. Shall be "cfg".

- edid-phandle: Optional proerty. phandle to the EDID handler block; if this
property is not specified it is assumed that EDID is handled by device
described by parent node of the HDMI RX node. You should not specify this
property if your HDMI RX controller does not have CEC.

- #address-cells: Required property. Shall be 1.

- #size-cells: Required property. Shall be 0.

You also have to create a subnode for the PHY device. PHY node properties are
as follows.

- compatible: Required property. Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405".

- reg: Required property. Shall be JTAG address of the PHY.

- clocks: Required property. Phandle for cfg clock.

- clock-names: Required property. Shall be "cfg".

A sample binding is now provided. The compatible string is for a SoC which has
has a Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX decoder inside.

Example:

dw_hdmi_soc: dw-hdmi-soc@0 {
	compatible = "...";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	hdmi-rx@0 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-rx";
		reg = <0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <1 2>;
		edid-phandle = <&dw_hdmi_soc>;

		clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
		clock-names = "cfg";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		hdmi-phy@fc {
			compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405";
			reg = <0xfc>;

			clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
			clock-names = "cfg";
		};
	};
};
