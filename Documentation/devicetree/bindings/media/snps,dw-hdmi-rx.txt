Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder
===================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
RX Decoder (DWC HDMI RX).

The properties bellow belong to the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder node.

Required properties:

- compatible: Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-rx".
- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC HDMI RX registers.
- interrupts: Reference to the DWC HDMI RX interrupt and the HDMI 5V sense
interrupt.
- clocks: Reference to the config clock.
- clock-names: Shall be "cfg".
- #address-cells: Shall be 1.
- #size-cells: Shall be 0.

Optional properties:

- edid-phandle: Reference to the EDID handler block; if this property is not
specified it is assumed that EDID is handled by device described by parent
node of the HDMI RX node. You should not specify this property if your HDMI RX
controller does not have CEC.

You also have to create a subnode for the PHY device. PHY node properties are
as follows.

Required properties:

- compatible: Shall be "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405".
- reg: Shall be the JTAG address of the PHY.
- clocks: Reference to the config clock.
- clock-names: Shall be "cfg".

Example:

hdmi_rx: hdmi-rx@0 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-rx";
	reg = <0x0 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <1 2>;
	edid-phandle = <&dw_hdmi_edid>;

	clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
	clock-names = "cfg";

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	hdmi-phy@fc {
		compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-phy-e405";
		reg = <0xfc>;

		clocks = <&dw_hdmi_refclk>;
		clock-names = "cfg";
	};
};
