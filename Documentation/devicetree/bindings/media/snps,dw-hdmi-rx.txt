Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX Decoder
===================================

This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
RX Decoder (DWC HDMI RX). It doesn't constitute a device tree binding
specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
device tree bindings.

When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
this document are defined as follows.

- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC HDMI RX registers.

- interrupts: Reference to the DWC HDMI RX interrupt and 5v sense interrupt.

- snps,hdmi-phy-jtag-addr: JTAG address of the phy to be used.

- snps,hdmi-phy-version: Version of the phy to be used.

- snps,hdmi-phy-cfg-clk: Value of the cfg clk that is delivered to phy.

- snps,hdmi-phy-driver: *Exact* name of the phy driver to be used.

- snps,hdmi-ctl-cfg-clk: Value of the cfg clk that is delivered to the
controller.

- edid-phandle: phandle to the EDID driver. It can be, for example, the main
wrapper driver.

A sample binding is now provided. The compatible string is for a wrapper driver
which then instantiates the Synopsys Designware HDMI RX decoder driver.

Example:

dw_hdmi_wrapper: dw-hdmi-wrapper@0 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-hdmi-rx-wrapper";
	reg = <0x0 0x10000>; /* controller regbank */
	interrupts = <1 3>; /* controller interrupt + 5v sense interrupt */
	snps,hdmi-phy-driver = "dw-hdmi-phy-e405";
	snps,hdmi-phy-version = <405>;
	snps,hdmi-phy-cfg-clk = <25>; /* MHz */
	snps,hdmi-ctl-cfg-clk = <25>; /* MHz */
	snps,hdmi-phy-jtag-addr = /bits/ 8 <0xfc>;
	edid-phandle = <&dw_hdmi_wrapper>;
};
