* Freescale enhanced Multimedia Accelerator (eMMA) video Pre-processor (PrP)
  for i.MX21 & i.MX27 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : Shall contain "fsl,imx21-emmaprp" for compatible with
               the one integrated on i.MX21 SoC.
- reg        : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts : Should contain eMMA PrP interrupt number.
- clocks     : Should contain the ahb and ipg clocks, in the order
               determined by the clock-names property.
- clock-names: Should be "ahb", "ipg".

Example:
	emmaprp: emmaprp@10026400 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx21-emmaprp";
		reg = <0x10026400 0x100>;
		interrupts = <51>;
		clocks = <&clks 49>, <&clks 68>;
		clock-names = "ipg", "ahb";
	};
