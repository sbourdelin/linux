Device-tree bindings for the Allegro DVT video IP codecs present in the Xilinx
ZynqMP SoC. The IP core may either be a H.264/H.265 encoder or H.264/H.265
decoder ip core.

Each actual codec engines is controlled by a microcontroller (MCU). Host
software uses a provided mailbox interface to communicate with the MCU. The
MCU share an interrupt.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be one of the following
    "allegro,al5e-1.1", "allegro,al5e": encoder IP core
    "allegro,al5d-1.1", "allegro,al5d": decoder IP core
  - reg: base and length of the memory mapped register region and base and
    length of the memory mapped sram
  - reg-names: must include "regs" and "sram"
  - interrupts: shared interrupt from the MCUs to the processing system
  - interrupt-names: "vcu_host_interrupt"

Example:
	al5e: al5e@a0009000 {
		compatible = "allegro,al5e";
		reg = <0 0xa0009000 0 0x1000>,
		      <0 0xa0000000 0 0x8000>;
		reg-names = "regs", "sram";
		interrupt-names = "vcu_host_interrupt";
		interrupts = <0 96 4>;
	};
	al5d: al5d@a0029000 {
		compatible = "allegro,al5d";
		reg = <0 0xa0029000 0 0x1000>,
		      <0 0xa0020000 0 0x8000>;
		reg-names = "regs", "sram";
		interrupt-names = "vcu_host_interrupt";
		interrupts = <0 96 4>;
	};
