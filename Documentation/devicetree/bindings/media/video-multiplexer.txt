Video Multiplexer
=================

Video multiplexers allow to select between multiple input ports. Video received
on the active input port is passed through to the output port. Muxes described
by this binding may be controlled by a syscon register bitfield or by a GPIO.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "video-multiplexer"
- reg: should be register base of the register containing the control bitfield
- bit-mask: bitmask of the control bitfield in the control register
- bit-shift: bit offset of the control bitfield in the control register
- gpios: alternatively to reg, bit-mask, and bit-shift, a single GPIO phandle
  may be given to switch between two inputs
- #address-cells: should be <1>
- #size-cells: should be <0>
- port@*: at least three port nodes containing endpoints connecting to the
  source and sink devices according to of_graph bindings. The last port is
  the output port, all others are inputs.

Example:

syscon {
	compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";

	mux {
		compatible = "video-multiplexer";
		/* Single bit (1 << 19) in syscon register 0x04: */
		reg = <0x04>;
		bit-mask = <1>;
		bit-shift = <19>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			mux_in0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&video_source0_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			mux_in1: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&video_source1_out>;
			};
		};

		port@2 {
			reg = <2>;

			mux_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&capture_interface_in>;
			};
		};
	};
};
