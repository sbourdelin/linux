Xilinx MIPI CSI2 Receiver Subsystem Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------------------

The Xilinx MIPI CSI2 Receiver Subsystem is used to capture MIPI CSI2 traffic
from compliant camera sensors and send the output as AXI4 Stream video data
for image processing.

The subsystem consists of a MIPI DPHY in slave mode which captures the
data packets. This is passed along the MIPI CSI2 Rx IP which extracts the
packet data. The Video Format Bridge (VFB) converts this data to AXI4 Stream
video data.

For more details, please refer to PG232 Xilinx MIPI CSI-2 Receiver Subsystem.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: Must contain "xlnx,mipi-csi2-rx-subsystem-4.0".
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.
- interrupts: Property with a value describing the interrupt number.
- clocks: List of phandles to AXI Lite, Video and 200 MHz DPHY clocks.
- clock-names: Must contain "lite_aclk" and "video_aclk" in the same order
  as clocks listed in clocks property.
- xlnx,csi-pxl-format: This denotes the CSI Data type selected in hw design.
  Packets other than this data type (except for RAW8 and User defined data
  types) will be filtered out. Possible values are as below -
  0x1E - YUV4228B
  0x1F - YUV42210B
  0x20 - RGB444
  0x21 - RGB555
  0x22 - RGB565
  0x23 - RGB666
  0x24 - RGB888
  0x28 - RAW6
  0x29 - RAW7
  0x2A - RAW8
  0x2B - RAW10
  0x2C - RAW12
  0x2D - RAW14
  0x2E - RAW16
  0x2F - RAW20


Optional properties:
--------------------
- xlnx,vfb: This is present when Video Format Bridge is enabled.
  Without this property the driver won't be loaded as IP won't be able to generate
  media bus format compliant stream output.
- xlnx,en-csi-v2-0: Present if CSI v2 is enabled in IP configuration.
- xlnx,en-vcx: When present, there are maximum 16 virtual channels, else
  only 4. This is present only if xlnx,en-csi-v2-0 is present.
- xlnx,en-active-lanes: Enable Active lanes configuration in Protocol
  Configuration Register.

Ports
-----
The device node shall contain two 'port' child nodes as defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

The port@0 is sink port and shall connect to CSI2 source like camera.
It must have the data-lanes property. It may have the xlnx,cfa-pattern
property to indicate bayer pattern of source.

The port@1 is source port could be connected to any video processing IP
which can work with AXI4 Stream data.

Required port properties:
--------------------
- reg: 0 - for sink port.
       1 - for source port.

Optional port properties:
--------------------
- xlnx,cfa-pattern: This goes in the sink port to indicate bayer pattern.
  Valid values are "bggr", "rggb", "gbrg" and "grbg".

Optional endpoint property:
---------------------------
- data-lanes: specifies MIPI CSI-2 data lanes as covered in video-interfaces.txt.
  This should be in the sink port endpoint which connects to MIPI CSI2 source
  like sensor. The possible values are:
  1       - For 1 lane enabled in IP.
  1 2     - For 2 lanes enabled in IP.
  1 2 3   - For 3 lanes enabled in IP.
  1 2 3 4 - For 4 lanes enabled in IP.

Example:

	csiss_1: csiss@a0020000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,mipi-csi2-rx-subsystem-4.0";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0020000 0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 95 4>;
		xlnx,csi-pxl-format = <0x2a>;
		xlnx,vfb;
		xlnx,en-active-lanes;
		xlnx,en-csi-v2-0;
		xlnx,en-vcx;
		clock-names = "lite_aclk", "video_aclk";
		clocks = <&misc_clk_0>, <&misc_clk_1>, <&misc_clk_2>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				/* Sink port */
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,cfa-pattern = "bggr"
				csiss_in: endpoint {
					data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
					/* MIPI CSI2 Camera handle */
					remote-endpoint = <&camera_out>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				/* Source port */
				reg = <1>;
				csiss_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vproc_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
