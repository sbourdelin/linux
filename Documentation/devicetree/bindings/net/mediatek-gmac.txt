MediaTek Gigabit Ethernet controller
=========================================

The gigabit ethernet controller can be found on MediaTek SoCs.

* Ethernet controller node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
	"mediatek,mt2712-eth": for MT2712 SoC
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the MAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: the name of interrupt in the interrupts property. These are
	"macirq": For MT2712 SoC
- clocks: the clock used by the controller
- clock-names: the names of the clock listed in the clocks property. These are
	"axi", "apb", "mac_ext", "ptp", "ptp_parent", "ptp_top": For MT2712 SoC
- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- power-domains: phandle to the power domain that the ethernet is part of
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- reset-gpio: gpio number for phy reset.

Example:

eth: eth@1101c000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt2712-eth";
		reg = <0 0x1101c000 0 0x1200>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 237 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq";
		phy-mode ="rgmii";
		mac-address = [00 55 7b b5 7d f7];
		clock-names = "axi",
			      "apb",
			      "mac_ext",
			      "ptp",
			      "ptp_parent",
			      "ptp_top";
		clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_GMAC>,
			 <&pericfg CLK_PERI_GMAC_PCLK>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHER_125M_SEL>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHER_50M_SEL>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_APLL1_D3>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_APLL1>;
		reset-gpio = <&pio 87 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};
