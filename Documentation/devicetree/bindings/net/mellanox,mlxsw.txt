Mellanox Technologies Switch ASICs

This file provides information, what the device node
for the Switch ASIC interface contains.

Required properties:
- compatible		: "mellanox,mlxsw_minimal"
- reg			: The I2C address of the device.

Optional properties:
- cooling-phandle	: phandle of the cooling device, which is to be used
			  for the zone thermal control.
			  If absent, cooling device controlled internally by
			  the ASIC may be used.

- trips			: the nodes to describe a point in the temperature
			  domain with key temperatures at which cooling is
			  recommended. Each node must contain the next values:
			  - type: the trip type. Expected values are:
			    0 - a trip point to enable active cooling;
			    1 - a trip point to enable passive cooling;
			    2 - a trip point to notify emergency;
			  - temperature: unsigned integer indicating the trip
			    temperature level in millicelsius;
			  - minimum cooling state allowed within the trip node;
			  - maximum cooling state allowed within the trip node;

Example:
	asic_thermal: mlxsw_minimal@48 {
		compatible = "mlxsw_minimal";
		reg = <0x48>;
		status = "disabled";
		cooling-phandle = <&cooling>;

		trips {
			trip@0 {
				trip = <0 75000 0 0>;
			};
			trip@1 {
				trip = <2 85000 1 5>;
			};
			trip@3 {
				trip = <2 105000 5 5>;
			};
		};
	};
