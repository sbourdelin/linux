* Common Ethernet Interface (BGX) block

Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx": Compatibility with all cn7xxx SOCs.

- reg: The base address of the BGX block.

- #address-cells: Must be <1>.

- #size-cells: Must be <0>.  BGX addresses have no size component.

Typically a BGX block has several children each representing a ethernet
interface.

Example:

	ethernet-mac-nexus@11800e0000000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx";
		reg = <0x00011800 0xe0000000 0x00000000 0x01000000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ethernet-mac@0 {
			...
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};


* Ethernet Interface (BGX port) connects to PKI/PKO

Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx-port": Compatibility with all cn7xxx
  SOCs.

- reg: The index of the interface withing the BGX block.

- local-mac-address: Mac address for the interface.

- phy-handle: phandle to the phy node connected to the interface.


* Ethernet Interface (BGX port) connects to XCV


Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7360-xcv": Compatibility with cn73xx SOCs.

- reg: The index of the interface withing the BGX block.

- local-mac-address: Mac address for the interface.

- phy-handle: phandle to the phy node connected to the interface.

- cavium,rx-clk-delay-bypass: Set to <1> to bypass the rx clock delay setting.
  Needed by the Micrel PHY.
