* Common Ethernet Interface (BGX) block

Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx": Compatibility with all cn7xxx SOCs.

- reg: The base address of the BGX block.

- #address-cells: Must be <1>.

- #size-cells: Must be <0>.  BGX addresses have no size component.

A BGX block has several children, each representing an Ethernet
interface.


* Ethernet Interface (BGX port) connects to PKI/PKO

Properties:

- compatible: "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx-port": Compatibility with all
	      cn7xxx SOCs.

	      "cavium,octeon-7360-xcv": Compatibility with cn73xx SOCs
	      for RGMII.

- reg: The index of the interface within the BGX block.

Optional properties:

- local-mac-address: Mac address for the interface.

- phy-handle: phandle to the phy node connected to the interface.

- phy-mode: described in ethernet.txt.

- fixed-link: described in fixed-link.txt.

Example:

	ethernet-mac-nexus@11800e0000000 {
		compatible = "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx";
		reg = <0x00011800 0xe0000000 0x00000000 0x01000000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ethernet-mac@0 {
			compatible = "cavium,octeon-7360-xcv";
			reg = <0>;
			local-mac-address = [ 00 01 23 45 67 89 ];
			phy-handle = <&phy3>;
			phy-mode = "rgmii-rxid"
		};
		ethernet-mac@1 {
			compatible = "cavium,octeon-7890-bgx-port";
			reg = <1>;
			local-mac-address = [ 00 01 23 45 67 8a ];
			phy-handle = <&phy4>;
			phy-mode = "sgmii"
		};
	};
