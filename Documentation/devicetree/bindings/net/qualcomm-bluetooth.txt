Qualcomm Bluetooth Chips
---------------------

This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
attached Qualcomm devices.

Serial attached Qualcomm devices shall be a child node of the host UART
device the slave device is attached to.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should contain one of the following:
   * "qcom,qca6174-bt"
   * "qcom,wcn3990-bt"

Optional properties:
 - enable-gpios: gpio specifier used to enable chip
 - clocks: clock provided to the controller (SUSCLK_32KHZ)
 - vddpa-supply: Bluetooth VDD PA regulator handle
 - vddio-supply: Bluetooth VDD IO regulator handle
 - vddldo-supply: Bluetooth VDD LDO regulator handle. Kept under optional
		  parameters as some of the chipsets doesn't require ldo or
		  it may use from same vddio.
 - vddxtal-supply: Bluetooth VDD XTAL regulator handle
 - vddcore-supply: Bluetooth VDD CORE regulator handle
 - vddpwd-supply: Chip power down gpio is required when bluetooth module
		  and other modules like wifi co-exist in a singe chip and
		  shares a common gpio to bring chip out of reset.
 - max-speed: operating speed of the chip.

Examples:

serial@7570000 {
	label = "BT-UART";
	status = "okay";

	bluetooth {
		compatible = "qcom,qca6174-bt";

		enable-gpios = <&pm8994_gpios 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&divclk4>;
	};
};

serial@898000 {
	label = "BT-UART";
	status = "okay";

	bluetooth: bt_wcn3990 {
		compatible = "qcom,wcn3990-bt";
		vddio-supply = <&pm8998_s3>;
		vddxtal-supply = <&pm8998_s5>;
		vddcore-supply = <&pm8998_l7>;
		vddpa-supply = <&pm8998_l17>;
		vddldo-supply = <&pm8998_l25>;
		max-speed = <3200000>;
	};
};
