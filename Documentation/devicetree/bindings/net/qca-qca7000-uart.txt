* Qualcomm QCA7000 (Ethernet over UART protocol)

Note: This binding applies in case the QCA7000 is configured as a
UART slave device. It is possible to preconfigure the UART settings
of the QCA7000 firmware, which can't be changed during runtime.

Required properties:
- compatible        : Should be "qca,qca7000-uart"

Optional properties:
- local-mac-address : 6 bytes, Specifies MAC address
- current-speed     : Specifies the serial device speed in
		      bits per second (default = 115200), which is
		      predefined by the QCA7000 firmware configuration

Example:

/* Freescale i.MX28 UART */
auart0: serial@8006a000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-auart", "fsl,imx23-auart";
	reg = <0x8006a000 0x2000>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&auart0_2pins_a>;
	status = "okay";

	qca7000: ethernet {
		compatible = "qca,qca7000-uart";
		local-mac-address = [ A0 B0 C0 D0 E0 F0 ];
		current-speed = <38400>;
	};
};
