Mediatek MT7530 Ethernet switch
================================

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be compatible = "mediatek,mt7530";
- #address-cells: Must be 1
- #size-cells: Must be 0
- mediatek,ethsys: Phandle to the syscon node that handles the reset.
- mediatek,ethernet: Phandle to the syscon node that Mediatek ethernet driver
	provides that handles the TRGMII setup used by the switch.
	See
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/mediatek-net.txt for the detailed
	setup on mediatek ethernet.
- mediatek,mcm: String, should be "enabled" or "disabled" to indicate that
	either MT7530 is the part on multi-chip module belong to MT7623A has
	or the remotely standalone chip as the function MT7623N reference board
	provided for.
- core-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the core power.
- io-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the I/O power
	See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mt6323-regulator.txt
	for details for the regulator setup on these boards.
- mediatek,reset-pin: Phandle to the pinctrl node used for the reset. Which
	must be required if the property mediatek,mcm of specified as
	"disabled". See
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-mt65xx.txt for
	the mediatek pintcrl setting for the details.

Each port children node within ports container must have the following
mandatory properties:
- reg			: Port address described must be 6 for CPU port
			and from 0 to 5 for user ports.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional
required, optional properties and how the integrated switch subnodes must
be specified.

Example:

	&mdio0 {
		switch@0 {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7530";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			mediatek,ethsys = <&ethsys>;
			mediatek,ethernet = <&eth>;
			mediatek,mcm = "enabled";
			core-supply = <&mt6323_vpa_reg>;
			io-supply = <&mt6323_vemc3v3_reg>;

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				reg = <0>;
				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "lan0";
				};

				port@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan1";
				};

				port@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					label = "lan2";
				};

				port@3 {
					reg = <3>;
					label = "lan3";
				};

				port@4 {
					reg = <4>;
					label = "wan";
				};

				port@6 {
					reg = <6>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&eth>;
					phy-mode = "trgmii";
					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
					};
				};
			};
		};
	};
