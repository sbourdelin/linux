Allwinner XRadio wireless SDIO devices

This node provides properties for controlling the XRadio wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
connects the device to the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "allwinner,xr819".

Optional properties:
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
	device interrupts are connected.
 - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt (host-wake).
	When not specified the device will use in-band SDIO interrupts.

Example:

mmc1: mmc@01c10000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mmc1_pins_a>;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_vcc_wifi>;
	mmc-pwrseq = <&wifi_pwrseq>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	non-removable;
	status = "okay";

	xr819: sdio_wifi@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		compatible = "allwinner,xr819";
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <6 10 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	};
};
