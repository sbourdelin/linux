Fixed transceiver Device Tree binding
------------------------------

CAN transceiver typically limits the max speed in standard CAN and CAN FD
modes. Typically these limitations are static and the transceivers themselves
provide no way to detect this limitation at runtime. For this situation,
the "fixed-transceiver" node can be used.

Properties:

Optional:
 max-arbitration-speed: a positive non 0 value that determines the max
			speed that CAN can run in non CAN-FD mode or during the
			arbitration phase in CAN-FD mode.

 max-data-speed:	a positive non 0 value that determines the max data rate
			that can be used in CAN-FD mode. A value of -1 implies
			CAN-FD is not supported by the transceiver.

Examples:

Based on Texas Instrument's TCAN1042HGV CAN Transceiver

m_can0 {
	....
	fixed-transceiver {
		max-arbitration-speed = <1000000>;
		max-data-speed = <5000000>;
	};
	...
};

Based on a CAN Transceiver that doesn't support CAN-FD. Only needed if the
CAN IP supports CAN-FD but is using a transceiver that doesn't.

m_can0 {
	....
	fixed-transceiver {
		max-data-speed = <(-1)>;
	};
	...
};
