MediaTek DWMAC glue layer controller

This file documents platform glue layer for stmmac.
Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.

The device node has following properties.

Required properties:
- compatible:  Should be "mediatek,mt2712-gmac" for MT2712 SoC
- reg:  Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts:  Should contain the MAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain a list of interrupt names corresponding to
	the interrupts in the interrupts property, if available.
	Should be "macirq" for the main MAC IRQ
- clocks: Must contain a phandle for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: the name of the clock listed in the clocks property. These are
	"axi", "apb", "mac_ext", "mac_parent", "ptp_ref", "ptp_parent", "ptp_top"
	for MT2712 SoC
- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt in the same directory

Example:

	eth: ethernet@1101c000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt2712-gmac";
		reg = <0 0x1101c000 0 0x1300>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 237 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq";
		phy-mode ="rgmii-id";
		mac-address = [00 55 7b b5 7d f7];
		clock-names = "axi",
			      "apb",
			      "mac_ext",
			      "mac_parent",
			      "ptp_ref",
			      "ptp_parent",
			      "ptp_top";
		clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_GMAC>,
			 <&pericfg CLK_PERI_GMAC_PCLK>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHER_125M_SEL>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHERPLL_125M>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_ETHER_50M_SEL>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_APLL1_D3>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_APLL1>;
		snps,txpbl = <32>;
		snps,rxpbl = <32>;
		snps,reset-gpio = <&pio 87 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		snps,reset-active-low;
	};
