STMicroelectronics STM32 / MCU DWMAC glue layer controller

This file documents platform glue layer for stmmac.
Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.

The device node has following properties.

Required properties:
- compatible:  Should be "st,stm32-dwmac" to select glue, and
	       "snps,dwmac-3.50a" to select IP vesrion.
- clocks: Should contain the GMAC main clock, and tx clock
- compatible:  Should be "st,stm32-dwmac" to select glue and
	       "snps,dwmac-3.50a" to select IP version.
- clocks: Should contain the MAC main clock
- clock-names: Should contain the clock names "stmmaceth".
- st,syscon : Should be phandle/offset pair. The phandle to the syscon node which
	      encompases the glue register, and the offset of the control register.

Optional properties:
- clocks: Could contain:
	- the tx clock,
	- the rx clock
- clock-names: Could contain the clock names "tx-clk", "rx-clk"

Example:

		ethernet0: dwmac@40028000 {
			device_type = "network";
			compatible = "st,stm32-dwmac", "snps,dwmac-3.50a";
			status = "disabled";
			reg = <0x40028000 0x8000>;
			reg-names = "stmmaceth";
			interrupts = <0 61 0>, <0 62 0>;
			interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
			clock-names = "stmmaceth", "tx-clk", "rx-clk";
			clocks = <&rcc 0 25>, <&rcc 0 26>, <&rcc 0 27>;
			st,syscon = <&syscfg 0x4>;
			snps,pbl = <32>;
			snps,mixed-burst;
			dma-ranges;
		};
