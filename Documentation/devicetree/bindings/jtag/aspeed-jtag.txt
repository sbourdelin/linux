Aspeed JTAG driver for ast2400 and ast2500 SoC

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of
      - "aspeed,ast2400-jtag"
      - "aspeed,ast2500-jtag"
- reg			contains the offset and length of the JTAG memory
			region
- clocks		root clock of bus, should reference the APB
			clock in the second cell
- resets		phandle to reset controller with the reset number in
			the second cell
- interrupts		should contain JTAG controller interrupt

Example:
jtag: jtag@1e6e4000 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-jtag";
	reg = <0x1e6e4000 0x1c>;
	clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB>;
	resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_JTAG_MASTER>;
	interrupts = <43>;
};
