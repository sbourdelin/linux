Aspeed JTAG driver for ast2400 and ast2500 SoC

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of
      - "aspeed,aspeed2400-jtag"
      - "aspeed,aspeed2500-jtag"
- reg			contains the offset and length of the JTAG memory
			region
- clocks		root clock of bus, should reference the APB clock
- reg-shift		device register offsets are shifted by this value
- interrupts		should contain JTAG controller interrupt

Optional properties:
- status 		 defines the operation status of the JTAG. Valid
values are:
      - "disabled"	 the JTAG is disabled
      - "okay"		 the JTAG is enabled

Example:
jtag: jtag@1e6e4000 {
	compatible = "aspeed,aspeed2500-jtag";
	reg = <0x1e6e4000 0x1c>;
	reg-shift = <2>;
	clocks = <&clk_apb>;
	interrupts = <43>;
	status = "disabled";
};
