Bindings for Intel PECI (Platform Environment Control Interface) hwmon driver.

Required properties:
- compatible
	Should be "intel,peci-hwmon".

- reg
	Should contain address of a client CPU. Address range of CPU clients is
	starting from 0x30 based on PECI specification.
	<0x30> .. <0x37> (depends on the PECI_OFFSET_MAX definition)

Example:
	peci-bus@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		< more properties >

		peci-hwmon@cpu0 {
			compatible = "intel,peci-hwmon";
			reg = <0x30>;
		};

		peci-hwmon@cpu1 {
			compatible = "intel,peci-hwmon";
			reg = <0x31>;
		};
	};
