Aspeed AST2400/2500 ADC

This device is a 10-bit converter for 16 voltage channels.  All inputs are
single ended.  Each channel can be individually enabled to allow for use of
alternate pin functions.

1) adc node

  Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be one of
	"aspeed,ast2400-adc"
	"aspeed,ast2500-adc"
  - reg : memory window mapping address and length
  - #address-cells : must be <1> corresponding to the channel child binding
  - #size-cells : must be <0> corresponding to the channel child binding
  - clocks : Input clock used to derive the sample clock. Expected to be the
    SoC's APB clock.
  - update-interval-ms : initial time between updates on a channel

  The node contains child nodes for each channel that the platform uses.

  Example adc node:
    adc@1e6e9000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-adc";
	reg = <0x1e6e9000 0xB0>;
	clocks = <&clk_apb>;
	update-interval-ms = <100>;

	[ child node definitions... ]
    };

2) channel nodes

  Optional properties:
  - status: indicates the operational status of the device.
    Value must be either "disabled" or "okay".
  - label : string describing the monitored value

  Example channel node:
  channel@1 {
	status = "okay";
	label = "3V3 rail";

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_adc0_default>;
  };
