Nuvoton NPCM7xx PWM and Fan Tacho controller device driver

The NPCM7xx has two identical Pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller modules,
Each PWM module has four PWM controller outputs, Totally 8 PWM controller outputs.

The NPCM7xx has eight identical Fan tachometer controller modules,
Each Fan module has two Fan controller inputs, Totally 16 Fan controller inputs.

Required properties for pwm-fan node:
- compatible	: "nuvoton,npcm750-pwm-fan" for Poleg NPCM7XX.
- reg 			: specifies physical base address and size of the registers.
- reg-names 	: must contain:
					* "pwm-base" for the PWM registers.
 					* "fan-base" for the Fan registers.
- clocks		: phandle of reference clocks.
- clock-names	: must contain
					* "clk_apb3" for clock of PWM controller.
 					* "clk_apb4" for clock of Fan controller.
- interrupts	: contain the Fan interrupts with flags for falling edge.
- pinctrl-names	: a pinctrl state named "default" must be defined.
- pinctrl-0 	: phandle referencing pin configuration of the PWM and Fan
					controller ports.

pwm subnode format:
===================
Under pwm subnode can be upto 8 child nodes, each child node representing a PWM channel.
Each pwm subnode must have one PWM channel and atleast one Fan tach channel.

For PWM channel can be configured cooling-levels to create cooling device.
Cooling device could be bound to a thermal zone for the thermal control.

Required properties for each child node:
- pwm-ch : specify the PWM output channel.
			integer value in the range 0 through 7, that represent
			the PWM channel number that used.

- fan-ch : specify the Fan input channel.
			integer value in the range 0 through 15, that represent
			the Fan channel number that used.

			At least one Fan tach input channel is required

Optional property for each child node:
- cooling-levels: PWM duty cycle values in a range from 0 to 255
                  which correspond to thermal cooling states.
