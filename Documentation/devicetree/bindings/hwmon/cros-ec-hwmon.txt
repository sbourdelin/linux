Chromium Embedded Controller EC temperature and fan control
-----------------------------------------------------------

Google's Chromium EC HWMON is a hwmon implemented byimplemented by the Chromium EC
firmware attached to the Embedded Controller (EC) and controlled via a host-command
interface.

An EC HWMON node should be only found as a sub-node of the EC node (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cros-ec.txt).

Required properties:
- compatible: Must contain "google,cros-ec-hwmon"

Example:
	embedded-controller@1e {
		reg = <0x1e>;
		compatible = "google,cros-ec-i2c";
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;

		hwmon {
			compatible = "google,cros-ec-hwmon";
		};
};
