= SUBNODES
The adsp node may have an subnode named either "smd-edge" or "glink-edge" that
describes the communication edge, channels and devices related to the ADSP.
See ../soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt and ../soc/qcom/qcom,glink.txt for details on how
to describe these.


= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
ADSP, as it is found on SDM845 boards.
