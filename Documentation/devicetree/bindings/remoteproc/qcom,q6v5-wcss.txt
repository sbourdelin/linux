Qualcomm Hexagon (Q6) - WCSS Peripheral Image Loader

This document defines the binding for a component that loads and boots firmware
on the integrated Qualcomm Hexagon - WCSS core.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,q6v5-wcss-pil",
- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: must specify the base address and size of the qdsp6 and
		    mpm (msm power manager) register blocks.

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "q6" and "mpm"

- interrupts-extended:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: must list the watchdog, fatal IRQs ready, handover and
		    stop-ack IRQs

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "wdog", "fatal", "ready", "handover", "stop-ack"

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: references to the axim-q6, axim2-q6, axi-wcss,
		    ahb-q6, ahbs-q6, ahb-wcss, ahbs-wcss, sysnoc and mem.
		    to be held on behalf of the booting of the Hexagon and WCSS
		    core. These are the interface, bus, mem clocks required for
		    the Q6 and WCSS cores.

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "axim-q6", "axim2-q6", "axi-wcss", "ahb-q6",
			    "ahbs-q6", "ahb-wcss", "ahbs-wcss", "sysnoc", "mem"

- resets:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reset-controller for the Q6-WCSS sub-system

- reset-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "wcss_aon_reset", "wcss_reset", "wcss_q6_reset"

- qcom,smem-states:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the smem state for requesting the Hexagon to
		    shut down

- qcom,smem-state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "stop"

- qcom,halt-regs:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: a phandle reference to a syscon representing TCSR followed
		    by the three offsets within syscon for q6, wcss and tcsr global
		    halt registers.

= SUBNODES:
The Hexagon node must contain a subnode, named "q6" representing
the memory region used by the Hexagon firmware. The sub-node must contain:

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reserved-memory for the Q6 firmware region

= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
Hexagon, as it is found on IPQ8074 boards.
