Required properties:
- compatible: must contain "qcom,hidma-1.0"
- reg: Addresses for the transfer and event channel
- interrupts: Should contain the event interrupt
- desc-count: Number of asynchronous requests this channel can handle
- event-channel: The HW event channel completions will be delivered.
Example:

	hidma_24: dma-controller@0x5c050000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hidma-1.0";
		reg = <0 0x5c050000 0x0 0x1000>,
		      <0 0x5c0b0000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 389 0>;
		desc-count = <10>;
		event-channel = <4>;
	};
