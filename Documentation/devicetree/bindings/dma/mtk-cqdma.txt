MediaTek Command-Queue DMA Controller
==================================

Required properties:

- compatible:	Must be "mediatek,mt6765-cqdma" for MT6765.
- reg:		Should contain the base address and length for each channel.
- interrupts:	Should contain references to the interrupts for each channel.
- clocks:	Should be the clock specifiers corresponding to the entry in
		clock-names property.
- clock-names:	Should contain "cqdma" entries.
- dma-channels: The number of DMA channels supported by the controller.
- dma-requests: The number of DMA request supported by the controller.
- #dma-cells: 	The length of the DMA specifier, must be <1>. This one cell
		in dmas property of a client device represents the channel
		number.
Example:

        cqdma: dma-controller@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6765-cqdma";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 113 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>,
			<GIC_SPI 114 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_IFR_CQ_DMA>;
		clock-names = "cqdma";
		dma-channels = <2>;
		dma-requests = <32>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
	};

DMA clients must use the format described in dma/dma.txt file.
