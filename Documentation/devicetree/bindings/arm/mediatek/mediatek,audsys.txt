MediaTek Audio Subsystem
============================
The audio subsystem is one of the multi-function blocks of MediaTek SoCs.
It contains a system controller, which provides a number registers giving
access to two features: AUDSYS clocks and Audio Front End (AFE) components.

For the top level node:
- compatible: must be: "syscon", "simple-mfd";
- reg: register area of the Audio Subsystem

Required sub-nodes:

AUDSYS clocks:
-------
The MediaTek AUDSYS controller provides various clocks to the system.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Should be one of:
	- "mediatek,mt2701-audsys";
	- "mediatek,mt7622-audsys";
- #clock-cells: Must be 1

The AUDSYS controller uses the common clk binding from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
The available clocks are defined in dt-bindings/clock/mt*-clk.h.

AFE components:
-------
For common binding part and usage, refer to
../sonud/mt2701-afe-pcm.txt.

Example:

	audio-subsystem@11220000 {
		compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0 0x11220000 0 0x2000>;

		audsys: clock {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt2701-audsys";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
		};

		...
	};
