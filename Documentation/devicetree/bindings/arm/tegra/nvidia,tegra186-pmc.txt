NVIDIA Tegra Power Management Controller (PMC)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
  - "nvidia,tegra186-pmc": for Tegra186
  - "nvidia,tegra194-pmc": for Tegra194
- reg: Must contain an (offset, length) pair of the register set for each
  entry in reg-names.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  - "pmc"
  - "wake"
  - "aotag"
  - "scratch"
  - "misc" (Only for Tegra194)

Optional properties:
- nvidia,invert-interrupt: If present, inverts the PMU interrupt signal.

Example:

SoC DTSI:

	pmc@c3600000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-pmc";
		reg = <0 0x0c360000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c370000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c380000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c390000 0 0x10000>;
		reg-names = "pmc", "wake", "aotag", "scratch";
	};

Board DTS:

	pmc@c360000 {
		nvidia,invert-interrupt;
	};

== Pad Control Nodes ==

The PMC can be used to set pad power state and voltage configuration.
The pad configuration is done via the pinctrl framework. The driver
implements power-source, low-power-enable, and low-power-disable pinconf
pin configuration node properties. Each pinctrl pin corresponds to a
single Tegra PMC pad. Thus, in the following sections of this document
pin refers to the pinctrl frameworks notion of a Tegra PMC pad.

The pad configuration state nodes are placed under the pmc node and they
are referred to by the pinctrl client device properties. For more
information see the examples presented later and
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

The values accepted by power-source property are
TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_1V8 and TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_3V3, which are defined
in dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra-io-pad.h.

Following pinctrl pin name strings are present on Tegra186:
csia		csib		dsi		mipi-bias
pex-clk-bias	pex-clk3	pex-clk2	pex-clk1
usb0		usb1		usb2		usb-bias
uart		audio		hsic		dbg
hdmi-dp0	hdmi-dp1	pex-cntrl	sdmmc2-hv
sdmmc4		cam		dsib		dsic
dsid		csic		csid		csie
dsif		spi		ufs		dmic-hv
edp		sdmmc1-hv	sdmmc3-hv	conn
audio-hv

All of the listed Tegra186 pins support the low-power-enable and
low-power-disable properties. The power-source property is supported
following Tegra210 pins: sdmmc2-hv, dmic-hv, sdmmc1-hv, sdmmc3-hv, and
audio-hv.

Pad configuration state example:
	pmc: pmc@7000e400 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-pmc";
		reg = <0 0x0c360000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c370000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c380000 0 0x10000>,
		      <0 0x0c390000 0 0x10000>;
		reg-names = "pmc", "wake", "aotag", "scratch";

		...

		sdmmc1_3v3: sdmmc1-3v3 {
			pins = "sdmmc1-hv";
			power-source = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_3V3>;
		};

		sdmmc1_1v8: sdmmc1-1v8 {
			pins = "sdmmc1-hv";
			power-source = <TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_1V8>;
		};

		hdmi_off: hdmi-off {
			pins = "hdmi";
			low-power-enable;
		}

		hdmi_on: hdmi-on {
			pins = "hdmi";
			low-power-disable;
		}
	};

Pinctrl client example:
	sdmmc1: sdhci@3400000 {
		...
		pinctrl-names = "sdmmc-3v3", "sdmmc-1v8";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sdmmc1_3v3>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&sdmmc1_1v8>;
	};

	...

	sor0: sor@15540000 {
		...
		pinctrl-0 = <&hdmi_off>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&hdmi_on>;
		pinctrl-names = "hdmi-on", "hdmi-off";
	};
