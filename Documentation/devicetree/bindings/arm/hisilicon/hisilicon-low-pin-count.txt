Hisilicon Hip06 low-pin-count device
  Usually LPC controller is part of PCI host bridge, so the legacy ISA ports
  locate on LPC bus can be accessed direclty. But some SoCs have independent
  LPC controller, and access the legacy ports by triggering LPC I/O cycles.
  Hisilicon Hip06 implements this LPC device.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "hisilicon,low-pin-count"
- #address-cells: must be 2 which stick to the ISA/EISA binding doc.
- #size-cells: must be 1 which stick to the ISA/EISA binding doc.
- reg: base address and length of the register set for the device.
- ranges: define a 1:1 mapping between the I/O space of the child device and
	  the parent.

Note:
  The node name before '@' must be "isa" to represent the binding stick to the
  ISA/EISA binding specification.

Example:

isa@a01b0000 {
	compatible = "hisilicom,low-pin-count";
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	reg = <0x0 0xa01b0000 0x0 0x1000>;
	ranges = <0x01 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x1000>;
};
