* CoreSight Debug Component:

CoreSight debug component are compliant with the ARMv8 architecture reference
manual (ARM DDI 0487A.k) Chapter 'Part H: External debug'. The external debug
module is mainly used for two modes: self-hosted debug and external debug, and
it can be accessed from mmio region from Coresight and eventually the debug
module connects with CPU for debugging. And the debug module provides
sample-based profiling extension, which can be used to sample CPU program
counter, secure state and exception level, etc; usually every CPU has one
dedicated debug module to be connected.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be
	     * "arm,coresight-debug", "arm,primecell"; supplemented with
	       "arm,primecell" as driver is using the AMBA bus interface.

- reg : physical base address and length of the register set.

- clocks : the clock associated to this component.

- clock-names : the name of the clock referenced by the code. Since we are
                using the AMBA framework, the name of the clock providing
		the interconnect should be "apb_pclk" and the clock is
		mandatory. The interface between the debug logic and the
		processor core is clocked by the internal CPU clock, so it
		is enabled with CPU clock by default.

- cpu : the cpu phandle the debug module is affined to. When omitted
	the source is considered to belong to CPU0.

Example:

	debug@f6590000 {
		compatible = "arm,coresight-debug","arm,primecell";
		reg = <0 0xf6590000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&sys_ctrl HI6220_DAPB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "apb_pclk";
		cpu = <&cpu0>;
	};
