== llcc amon device ==

Properties:
-qcom,fg-cnt : The value of fine grained counter of activity monitor
	        block.

compatible devices:
		qcom,sdm845-llcc

Example:

	qcom,system-cache@1300000 {
		compatible = "qcom,llcc-core", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x1300000 0x50000>;
		reg-names = "llcc_base";

		llcc: qcom,sdm845-llcc {
			compatible = "qcom,sdm845-llcc";
			#cache-cells = <1>;
			max-slices = <32>;
		};

		qcom,llcc-ecc {
			compatible = "qcom,llcc-ecc";
		};

		qcom,llcc-amon {
			compatible = "qcom,llcc-amon";
			qcom,fg-cnt = <0x7>;
		};

	};

== Client ==

Properties:
- cache-slice-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: A set of names that identify the usecase names of a client that uses
		    cache slice. These strings are used to look up the cache slice
		    entries by name.

- cache-slices:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The tuple has phandle to llcc device as the first argument and the
		    second argument is the usecase id of the client.
For example:

	video-decoder-encoder {
		cache-slice-names = "vidsc0", "vidsc1";
		cache-slices = <&llcc 2>, <&llcc 3>;
	};
