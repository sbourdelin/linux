Command DB
---------

Command DB is a database that provides a mapping between resource key and the
resource address for a system resource managed by a remote processor. The data
is stored in a shared memory region and is loaded by the remote processor.

Some of the Qualcomm Technologies Inc SoC's have hardware accelerators for
controlling shared resources. Depending on the board configuration the shared
resource properties may change. These properties are dynamically probed by the
remote processor and made available in the shared memory.

The devicetree representation of the command DB driver should be:

PROPERTIES:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,cmd-db"

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: The phandle to the reserved memory region.

Example:

	reserved-memory {
		[...]
		cmd_db_mem: qcom,cmd-db@c3f000c {
			reg = <0x0 0xc3f000c 0x0 0x8>;
		};
	};

	qcom,cmd-db@c3f000c {
		compatible = "qcom,cmd-db";
		memory-region = <&cmd_db_mem>;
	};
