Hisilicon mbigen device tree bindings.
=======================================

Mbigen means: message based interrupt generator.

MBI is kind of msi interrupt only used on Non-PCI devices.

To reduce the wired interrupt number connected to GIC,
Hisilicon designed mbigen to collect and generate interrupt.


Non-pci devices can connect to mbigen and generate the
interrupt by writing ITS register.

The mbigen chip and devices connect to mbigen have the following properties:

Mbigen main node required properties:
-------------------------------------------
- compatible: Should be "hisilicon,mbigen-v2"
- reg: Specifies the base physical address and size of the Mbigen
  registers.
- interrupt controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- msi-parent: This property has two cells.
	The 1st cell specifies the ITS this device connected.
	The 2nd cell specifies the device id.
- nr-msis:Specifies the total number of interrupt this device has.
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value is 2 now.

  The 1st cell is global hardware pin number of the interrupt.
		This value depends on the Soc design.
  The 2nd cell is the interrupt trigger type.

Examples:

 	mbigen_device_gmac:intc {
			compatible = "hisilicon,mbigen-v2";
			reg = <0x0 0xc0080000 0x0 0x10000>;
			interrupt-controller;
			msi-parent = <&its_dsa 0x40b1c>;
			num-msis = <9>;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
 	};

Devices connect to mbigen required properties:
----------------------------------------------------
-interrupt-parent: Specifies the mbigen device node which device connected.
-interrupts:specifies the interrupt source.
  The 1st cell is global hardware pin number of the interrupt.
		This value depends on the Soc design.
  The 2nd cell is the interrupt trigger type

Examples:
	gmac0: ethernet@c2080000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0 0xc2080000 0 0x20000>,
		      <0 0xc0000000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent  = <&mbigen_device_gmac>;
		interrupts =	<656 1>,
				<657 1>;
	};
