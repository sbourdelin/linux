* ON Semiconductor - NCP5623 3-Channel LED Driver

The NCP5623 is a 3-channel I2C LED driver. The brightness of each
channel can be independently set using 32 levels. Each LED is represented
as a sub-node of the device.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "onnn,ncp5623"
  - reg: I2C slave address (fixed to 0x38)
  - #address-cells: must be 1
  - #size-cells: must be 0
  - onnn,led-iref-microamp: Current on the Iref pin in microampere. It depends
    on the value of the external bias resistor Rbias, following
    Iref = Vref / Rbias with Vref = 0.6V. This is used to set the intensity of
    the current that can be provided by the internal current source, based on
    the maximum current permitted by LED sub-nodes (see below), but no more than
    Imax = 2400 * Iref.

LED sub-nodes
=============

Required properties:
  - reg : LED channel number (0..2)
  - led-max-microamp: Maximum allowable current inside the LED in microampere.
    This property is used to limit the PWM ratio, based on the intensity of the
    internal current source (see above).

Optional properties:
  - label: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - linux,default-trigger: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example
=======

led1: ncp5623@38 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "onnn,ncp5623";
	reg = <0x38>;
	onnn,led-iref-microamp = <10>;

	led1r@0 {
		label = "ncp:power:red";
		linux,default-trigger = "default-on";
		reg = <0>;
		led-max-microamp = <20000>;
	};

	led1b@1 {
		label = "ncp:power:blue";
		reg = <1>;
		led-max-microamp = <20000>;
	};

	led1g@2 {
		label = "ncp:power:green";
		reg = <2>;
		led-max-microamp = <20000>;
	};
};
