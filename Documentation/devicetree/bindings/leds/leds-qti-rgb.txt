Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. TRI_LED driver specific bindings

This binding document describes the properties of TRI_LED module in
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC chips.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must be "qcom,leds-rgb".

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Register base of the TRI_LED module and length.

- pwm-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: A list of string to label the PWM devices defined in pwms
		property which are using for controlling LEDs.
		It must be: "blue", "green", "red".

- pwms:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of the PWM devices (phandles) used for controlling
		LEDs.

- qcom,support-blink:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: An array of integer values to indicate if "blue", "green", "red"
		LEDs support blink control. The values are listed as the fixed
		order for "blue", "green", "red" LEDs.

- qcom,on-ms:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: An array of time values (milli-seconds) to represent the
		on duration for "blue", "green", "red" LEDs. The values are
		listed as the fixed order for "blue", "green", "red" LEDs.
		This property has to be defined if "qcom,support-blink" is
		present.

- qcom,off-ms:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: An array of time values (milli-seconds) to represent the
		off duration for "blue", "green", "red" LEDs. The values are
		listed as the fixed order for "blue", "green", "red" LEDs.
		This property has to be defined if "qcom,support-blink" is
		present.

Example:

	pmi8998_rgb: rgb@d000{
		compatible = "qcom,leds-rgb";
		reg = <0xd000 0x100>;
		pwm-names = "blue", "green", "red";
		pwms =  <&pmi8998_pwm_3 0 1000000>,
			<&pmi8998_pwm_4 0 1000000>,
			<&pmi8998_pwm_5 0 1000000>;
		qcom,support-blink = <1 1 1>;
		qcom,on-ms = <500 500 500>;
		qcom,off-ms = <500 500 500>;
	};
