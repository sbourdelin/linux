* Texas Instruments - LM3697 Highly Efficient White LED Driver

The LM3697 11-bit LED driver provides high-
performance backlight dimming for 1, 2, or 3 series
LED strings while delivering up to 90% efficiency.

This device is suitable for display and keypad Lighting

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		"ti,lm3697"
	- reg :  I2C slave address
	- #address-cells : 1
	- #size-cells : 0

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpios : GPIO pin to enable/disable the device
	- vled-supply : LED supply

Required child properties:
	- reg : 0 - LED is Controlled by bank A
		1 - LED is Controlled by bank B
	- led-sources : Indicates which HVLED string is associated to which
			control bank.  Each element in the array is associated
			with a specific HVLED string.  Element 0 is HVLED1,
			element 1 is HVLED2 and element 2 HVLED3.
			Additional information is contained
			in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
			0 - HVLED is not active in this control bank
			1 - HVLED string is controlled by this control bank

Optional child properties:
	- runtime-ramp-up-msec: Current ramping from one brightness level to
				the a higher brightness level.
				Range from 2048 us - 117.44 s
	- runtime-ramp-down-msec: Current ramping from one brightness level to
				  the a lower brightness level.
				  Range from 2048 us - 117.44 s
	- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger :
	   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

HVLED string 1 and 3 are controlled by control bank A and HVLED 2 string is
controlled by control bank B.

led-controller@36 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3697";
	reg = <0x36>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vled-supply = <&vbatt>;

	led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		led-sources = <1 0 1>;
		runtime-ramp-up-msec = <5000>;
		runtime-ramp-down-msec = <1000>;
		label = "white:first_backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};

	led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		led-sources = <0 1 0>;
		runtime-ramp-up-msec = <500>;
		runtime-ramp-down-msec = <1000>;
		label = "white:second_backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};
}

All HVLED strings controlled by control bank A

led-controller@36 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3697";
	reg = <0x36>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vled-supply = <&vbatt>;

	led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		led-sources = <1 1 1>;
		runtime-ramp-up-msec = <500>;
		runtime-ramp-down-msec = <1000>;
		label = "white:backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};
}
