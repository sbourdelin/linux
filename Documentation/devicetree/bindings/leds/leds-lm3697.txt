* Texas Instruments - LM3697 Highly Efficient White LED Driver

The LM3697 11-bit LED driver provides high-
performance backlight dimming for 1, 2, or 3 series
LED strings while delivering up to 90% efficiency.

This device is suitable for Display and Keypad Lighting

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		"ti,lm3967"
	- reg :  I2C slave address
	- #address-cells : 1
	- #size-cells : 0

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpios : gpio pin to enable/disable the device.
	- vled-supply : LED supply

Required child properties:
	- reg : 0 - LED is Controlled by bank A
		1 - LED is Controlled by bank B
	- led-sources - Indicates which HVLED string is associated to which
			control bank.  The HVLED string cannot be associated with
			two control banks.  This property is an array of 3 and
			all positions in the array must be populated.
			Additional information is contained
			in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
			0 - End of array if all 3 LEDs are not declared for a
			    single control bank.
			1 - HVLED 1 string
			2 - HVLED 2 string
			3 - HVLED 3 string

Optional child properties:
	- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger :
	   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

HVLED string 1 and 2 controlled by control bank A and HVLED string controlled by
control bank B.

led-controller@36 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3967";
	reg = <0x36>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vled-supply = <&vbatt>;

	led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		led-sources = <0x1 0x2 0x0>;
		label = "white:first_backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};

	led@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		led-sources = <0x3 0x0 0x0>;
		label = "white:second_backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};
}

All HVLED strings controlled by control bank A

led-controller@36 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3967";
	reg = <0x36>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	enable-gpios = <&gpio1 28 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	vled-supply = <&vbatt>;

	led@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		led-sources = <0x1 0x2 0x3>;
		label = "white:backlight_cluster";
		linux,default-trigger = "backlight";
	};
}
