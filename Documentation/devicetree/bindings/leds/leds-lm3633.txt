* Texas Instruments - LM3633 Lighting Power Solution for Smartphone Handsets

The LM3633 is a complete power source for
backlight, keypad, and indicator LEDs in smartphone
handsets.

This device is suitable for display and keypad Lighting

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		"ti,lm3633"
	- reg :  I2C slave address
	- #address-cells : 1
	- #size-cells : 0

Optional properties:
	- enable-gpios : GPIO pin to enable/disable the device
	- vled-supply : LED supply

Required child properties:
	- reg : 0 - HVLED is Controlled by bank A
		1 - HVLED is Controlled by bank B
		2,3,4 - LVLED1, 2 and 3 are Controlled by bank C, D and E
		5,6,7 - LVLED4, 5 and 6 are Controlled by bank F, G and H
	- led-sources : Indicates which LED string is associated to which
			control bank.
			0 - LED is not active in this control bank
			1 - LED string is controlled by this control bank

Optional child properties:
	- runtime-ramp-up-msec: Current ramping from one brightness level to
				the a higher brightness level.
				Range from 2048 us - 117.44 s
	- runtime-ramp-down-msec: Current ramping from one brightness level to
				  the a lower brightness level.
				  Range from 2048 us - 117.44 s
	- label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger :
	   see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:
Control bank C output to 3 LVLEDs and Control F, G and H have independent
controls of the LVLEDs.
