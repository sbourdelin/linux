MediaTek Seria ATA controller

Required properties:
 - compatible	   : Must be "mediatek,ahci".
 - reg		   : Physical base addresses and length of register sets.
 - interrupts	   : Interrupt associated with the SATA device.
 - interrupt-names : Associated name must be: "hostc".
 - clocks	   : The phandle for the clock.
 - clock-names	   : Associated name must be: "ahb", "axi", "asic", "rbc", "pm"
 - phys		   : The phandle for the PHY port.
 - phy-names	   : Associated name must be: "sata-phy".
 - ports-implemented : Mask that indicates which ports that the HBA supports
		       are available for software to use. Useful if PORTS_IMPL
		       is not programmed by the BIOS, which is true with some
		       embedded SOC's.
Optional properties:
 - power-domains   : A phandle and power domain specifier pair to the power
		     domain which is responsible for collapsing and restoring
		     power to the peripheral.
 - resets	   : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
		     See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
 - reset-names	   : Associated names must be: "axi-rst", "sw-rst", "reg-rst".
 - mediatek,phy-mode : A phandle to the system controller, used to enable
		       SATA function.

Example:

	sata: sata@1a200000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,ahci";
		reg = <0 0x1a200000 0 0x1100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 233 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "hostc";
		clocks = <&pciesys CLK_SATA_AHB_EN>,
			 <&pciesys CLK_SATA_AXI_EN>,
			 <&pciesys CLK_SATA_ASIC_EN>,
			 <&pciesys CLK_SATA_RBC_EN>,
			 <&pciesys CLK_SATA_PM_EN>;
		clock-names = "ahb", "axi", "asic", "rbc", "pm";
		phys = <&u3port1 PHY_TYPE_SATA>;
		phy-names = "sata-phy";
		ports-implemented = <0x1>;
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT7622_POWER_DOMAIN_HIF0>;
		resets = <&pciesys MT7622_SATA_AXI_BUS_RST>,
			 <&pciesys MT7622_SATA_PHY_SW_RST>,
			 <&pciesys MT7622_SATA_PHY_REG_RST>;
		reset-names = "axi-rst", "sw-rst", "reg-rst";
		mediatek,phy-mode = <&pciesys>;
	};
