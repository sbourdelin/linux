Device tree binding for the TI DM816 AHCI SATA Controller
---------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
  - compatible: must be "ti,dm816-ahci"
  - reg: physical base address and size of the register region used by
         the controller (as defined by the AHCI 1.1 standard)
  - interrupts: interrupt specifier (refer to the interrupt binding)
  - clocks: clock specifiers (refer to the clock binding); two clocks
            must be specified: the functional clock and an external
            reference clock

Example:

	sata: sata@4a140000 {
		compatible = "ti,dm816-ahci";
		reg = <0x4a140000 0xffff>;
		interrupts = <16>;
		clocks = <&sysclk5_ck>, <&sata_refclk>;
	};
