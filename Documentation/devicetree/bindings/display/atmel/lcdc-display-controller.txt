		reg = <0x700000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 3>;
		clocks = <&lcd_clk>, <&lcd_clk>;
		clock-names = "lcdc_clk", "hclk";

		lcdc-display-controller {
			compatible = "atmel,lcdc-display-controller";
			lcd-supply = <&lcdc_reg>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				lcdc_panel_output: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_input>;
				};
			};
