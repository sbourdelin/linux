Intel Video and Image Processing(VIP) Frame Buffer II bindings

Supported hardware: Arria 10 and above with display port IP

The hardware associated with this device tree is a SoC FPGA. Where there is an ARM controller
and a FPGA device. The ARM controller would host the Linux OS while the FPGA device runs on its
individual IP firmware. In the Intel VIP Frame Buffer II the ARM controller would be 
driving data from the Linux OS to the FPGA device programmed with the Frame Buffer II IP
to render pixels to be streamed to the Display Port connector.

The DRM driver for the Arria 10 devkit would require the display resolution
and pixel information to be included as these values are generated based
on the FPGA design that drives the video connector attached to the DRM driver.

The Frame Buffer II device is a simple frame buffer device. The device contains the display
properties and the bridge or connector register. The output for this device currently 
is a dedicated to a single Display Port.

Required properties:
----------------------------
- compatible: "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the framebuffer controller's
  registers.
- altr,max-width: The width of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,max-height: The height of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,bits-per-symbol: only "8" is currently supported
- altr,mem-port-width = the bus width of the avalon master port on the frame reader

Example:
----------------------------
	dp_0_frame_buf: vip@100000280 {
			compatible = "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0";
			reg = <0x00000001 0x00000280 0x00000040>;
			altr,max-width = <1280>;
			altr,max-height = <720>;
			altr,bits-per-symbol = <8>;
			altr,mem-port-width = <128>;
	};
