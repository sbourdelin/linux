Intel Video and Image Processing(VIP) Frame Buffer II bindings

Supported hardware: Arria 10 and above with display port IP

The drm driver for the Arria 10 devkit would require the display resolution
and pixel information to be included as these values are generated based
on the FPGA design that drives the video connector attached to the drm driver
Information the FPGA video IP component can be acquired from

Required properties:

- compatible: "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the framebuffer controller's
  registers.
- altr,max-width: The width of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,max-height: The height of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,bits-per-symbol: only "8" is currently supported
- altr,mem-port-width = the bus width of the avalon master port on the frame reader

Example:

	dp_0_frame_buf: vip@100000280 {
			compatible = "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0";
			reg = <0x00000001 0x00000280 0x00000040>;
			altr,max-width = <1280>;
			altr,max-height = <720>;
			altr,bits-per-symbol = <8>;
			altr,mem-port-width = <128>;
	};
