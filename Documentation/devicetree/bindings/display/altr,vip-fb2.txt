Intel Video and Image Processing(VIP) Frame Buffer II bindings

Supported hardware: Intel FPGA SoC Arria10 and above with display port IP

The Video Frame Buffer II in Video Image Processing (VIP) suite is an IP core
that interfaces between system memory and Avalon-ST video ports. The IP core
can be configured to support the memory reader (from memory to Avalon-ST)
and/or memory writer (from Avalon-ST to memory) interfaces.

DT-Bindings:
=============
Required properties:
----------------------------
- compatible: "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the framebuffer controller's
	registers.
- altr,max-width: The maximum width of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,max-height: The maximum height of the framebuffer in pixels.
- altr,mem-port-width = the bus width of the avalon master port
	on the frame reader

Optional sub-nodes:
- ports: The connection to the encoder

Optional properties
----------------------------
- compatible: "altr, display-port"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the display port controller's
	registers
- clocks: required clock handles for specified pairs in clock name
- clock-names: required clock names. Contains:
	- aux_clk: auxiliary clock,
	- clk: 100 MHz output clock
	- xcvr_mgmt_clk: transceiver management clock

Optional sub-nodes:
- ports: The connection to the controller

Connections between the Frame Buffer II and other video IP cores in the system
are modelled using the OF graph DT bindings. The Frame Buffer II node has up
to two OF graph ports. When the memory writer interface is enabled, port 0
maps to the Avalon-ST Input (din) port. When the memory reader interface is
enabled, port 1 maps to the Avalon-ST Output (dout) port.

The encoder is built into the FPGA HW design and therefore would not
be accessible from the DDR.

Required Properties Example:
----------------------------

framebuffer@100000280 {
		compatible = "altr,vip-frame-buffer-2.0";
		reg = <0x00000001 0x00000280 0x00000040>;
		altr,max-width = <1280>;
		altr,max-height = <720>;
		altr,mem-port-width = <128>;

		ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
					fb_output: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint = <&dp_encoder_input>;
					};
			};
		};
};

Optional Properties Example:
This is not required unless there are needs to customize
Display Port controller settings.

displayport@100002000 {
		compatible = "altr, display-port";
		reg = <0x00000001 0x00002000 0x00000800>;
		clocks = <&dp_0_clk_16 &dp_0_clk_100 &dp_0_clk_100>;
		clock-names = "aux_clk", "clk", "xcvr_mgmt_clk";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <1>;
					dp_input: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint = <&dp_controller_input>;
					};
			};
};
