Xilinx KMS Pipeline
-------------------

Xilinx display pipelines can be designed with hardened video IPs and soft video
IPs in programmable logic. This KMS module provides the common functionality
of individual subdevice drivers, and glue logics between them.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,kms".

- ports: phandles for CRTC ports, using the DT bindings defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Example:

	xlnx_drm: xlnx_drm {
		compatible = "xlnx,kms";
		ports = <&crtc_port>;
	};
