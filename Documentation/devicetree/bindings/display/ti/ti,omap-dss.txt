Texas Instruments OMAP Display Subsystem
========================================

Generic Description
-------------------

This document is a generic description of the OMAP Display Subsystem bindings.
Binding details for each OMAP SoC version are described in respective binding
documentation.

The OMAP Display Subsystem (DSS) hardware consists of DSS Core, DISPC module and
a number of encoder modules. All DSS versions contain DSS Core and DISPC, but
the encoder modules vary.

The DSS Core is the parent of the other DSS modules, and manages clock routing,
integration to the SoC, etc.

DISPC is the display controller, which reads pixels from the memory and outputs
a RGB pixel stream to encoders.

The encoder modules encode the received RGB pixel stream to a video output like
HDMI, MIPI DPI, etc.

DISPC
-----

Optional properties:
- max-memory-bandwidth: Input memory (from main memory to dispc) bandwidth limit
			in bytes per second
- plane: Child node(s) which defines which logical plane are available to
	the system. If at least one plane child node is defined then
	only planes defined by these nodes will be available to the system.
	Plane nodes must be sequential starting with reg = <0> as DT parsing
	will stop on the first missing numbered node.
	This means if plane #1 is defined but plane #0 is not then it will
	be as if none of the plane nodes were defined.

	Each plane node contains the following properties:
	Required properties:
	- reg:       Used to number the logical plane
	- hw-planes: One or two HW plane number(s).
		     When 2 numbers are present this indicates a virtual plane
		     composed of two physical planes intended to be used
		     when the display is larger then the capacity of a
		     single plane i.e. wider than 2048 pixels.
		     The first number in the pair will dictate the capabilities
		     of the virtual plane. This means that for proper
		     operation the virtual plane should be composed of HW
		     planes of the same capabilities.
		     If GFX plane is used in a virtual plane it should be
		     specified first, otherwise unexpected behavior would
		     be encountered.
	Optional property:
	- hw-crtcs:  One or more HW crtc number(s).
		     Describe the list of CRTCs on which this plane is
		     available. If this node is not present then the
		     plane will be available on all available CRTCs.

Video Ports
-----------

The DSS Core and the encoders have video port outputs. The structure of the
video ports is described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt,
and the properties for the ports and endpoints for each encoder are
described in the SoC's DSS binding documentation.

The video ports are used to describe the connections to external hardware, like
panels or external encoders.

Aliases
-------

The board dts file may define aliases for displays to assign "displayX" style
name for each display. If no aliases are defined, a semi-random number is used
for the display.

Example

A shortened example of the DSS description for OMAP4, with non-relevant parts
removed, defined in omap4.dtsi:

dss: dss@58000000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-dss";
	reg = <0x58000000 0x80>;
	status = "disabled";
	ti,hwmods = "dss_core";
	clocks = <&dss_dss_clk>;
	clock-names = "fck";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	dispc@58001000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-dispc";
		reg = <0x58001000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 25 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		ti,hwmods = "dss_dispc";
		clocks = <&dss_dss_clk>;
		clock-names = "fck";
	};

	hdmi: encoder@58006000 {

A shortened example of the board description for OMAP4 Panda board, defined in
omap4-panda.dts.

The Panda board has a DVI and a HDMI connector, and the board contains a TFP410
chip (MIPI DPI to DVI encoder) and a TPD12S015 chip (HDMI ESD protection & level
shifter). The video pipelines for the connectors are formed as follows:

DSS Core --(MIPI DPI)--> TFP410 --(DVI)--> DVI Connector
OMAP HDMI --(HDMI)--> TPD12S015 --(HDMI)--> HDMI Connector

A short example on how to define a virtual plane configuration
to enable wide display support.
Here we define:
- plane#0 to be the HW plane #0 (i.e. GFX plane)
	  only available on crtc #0
- plane#1 to be a virtual wide plane composed of HW plane #1 and #2
	  (i.e. VID1 & VID2) available on crtc #0 & #1
- plane#2 to be the HW plane #3 (i.e. VID3 plane)
	  only available on crtc #0

&dss {
        dispc@58001000 {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;

                plane@0 {
                        reg = <0>;
                        hw-planes = <0>;
                        hw-crtcs = <0>;
                };

                plane@1 {
                        reg = <1>;
                        hw-planes = <1 2>;
                        hw-crtcs = <0 1>;
                };

                plane@2 {
                        reg = <2>;
                        hw-planes = <3>;
                        hw-crtcs = <0>;
                };
        };
};
