Simple display panel
====================

panel node
----------

Required properties:
- power-supply: See panel-common.txt

Optional properties:
- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle of an I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable or disable the panel
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel

display-timings subnode
-----------------------

This optional subnode is for devices which require a mode differing from the
panel's "typical" display timing as programmed in the simple-panel driver.
Overriding the driver mode must only be done in the following scenario:
 - The restrictions motivating the override cannot be applied to the platform's
   display driver (ie: it must be specific to the device not the platform)
 - The panel must not have a fixed mode attributed to it in the driver
 - The panel must provide at list one display_timing range by which the override
   mode can be validated against
 - The override mode will use the 'typ' values from the display-timings subnode
 - You must provide all required properties for the display-timings subnode

Format information on the display-timings subnode can be found in
display-timing.txt.


Example:

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "cptt,claa101wb01";
		ddc-i2c-bus = <&panelddc>;

		power-supply = <&vdd_pnl_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpio 90 0>;

		backlight = <&backlight>;

		display-timings {
			timing0: override {
				clock-frequency = <266604720>;
				hactive = <2400>;
				hfront-porch = <48>;
				hback-porch = <84>;
				hsync-len = <32>;
				vactive = <1600>;
				vfront-porch = <3>;
				vback-porch = <120>;
				vsync-len = <10>;
			};
		};
	};
