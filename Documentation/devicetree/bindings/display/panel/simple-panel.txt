Simple display panel

Required properties:
- power-supply: regulator to provide the supply voltage

Optional properties:
- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle of an I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable or disable the panel
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
- override-mode: For devices which require a mode which differs from the
		 display_timing's "typical" mode, and whose restrictions cannot
		 be applied across the entire platform. The mode must fall
		 within the bounds of the panel's specified display_timing, and
		 cannot be used if the panel already specifies a single fixed
		 mode. The format is specified under "timing subnode" in
		 display-timing.txt


Example:

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "cptt,claa101wb01";
		ddc-i2c-bus = <&panelddc>;

		power-supply = <&vdd_pnl_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpio 90 0>;

		backlight = <&backlight>;

		override-mode {
			clock-frequency = <266604720>;
			hactive = <2400>;
			hfront-porch = <48>;
			hback-porch = <84>;
			hsync-len = <32>;
			vactive = <1600>;
			vfront-porch = <3>;
			vback-porch = <120>;
			vsync-len = <10>;
		}
	};
