Video Graphics Array

This binding is for simple panels using the standardized VGA resolutions
defined by de facto standards beginning with the IBM PS/2 in 1987.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "video-graphics-array"

This binding is compatible with the simple-panel binding, which is specified
in simple-panel.txt in this directory.

panel {
	compatible = "video-graphics-array";
	port {
		vga_panel_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&foo>;
		};
	};
};
