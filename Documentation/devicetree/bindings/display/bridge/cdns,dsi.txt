Cadence DSI bridge
==================

The Cadence DSI bridge is a DPI to DSI bridge supporting up to 4 DSI lanes.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be set to "cdns,dsi".
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- interrupts: interrupt line connected to the DSI bridge.
- clocks: DSI bridge clocks.
- clock-names: must contain "pclk" and "sysclk".
- phys: phandle link to the MIPI D-PHY controller.
- phy-names: must contain "dphy".
- #address-cells: must be set to 1.
- #size-cells: must be set to 0.

Required subnodes:
- ports: Ports as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
  Currently contains a single input port at address 0 representing the DPI
  input. Other ports will be added later to support the SDI inputs.
  Port 0 should be connected to a DPI encoder output.
- one subnode per DSI device connected on the DSI bus. Each DSI device should
  contain a reg property encoding its address on the bus.

Example:

	dsi0: dsi@fd0c0000 {
		compatible = "cdns,dsi";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd0c0000 0x0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&pclk>, <&sysclk>;
		clock-names = "pclk", "hclk";
		interrupts = <1>;
		phys = <&dphy1>;
		phy-names = "dphy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				dsi0_dpi_input: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&xxx_dpi_output>;
				};
			};
		};

		panel: dsi-dev@0 {
			compatible = "<vendor,panel>";
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
