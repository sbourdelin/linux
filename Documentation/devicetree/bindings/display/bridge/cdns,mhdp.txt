Cadence MHDP bridge
==========================

The Cadence MHDP bridge is a DPI to DP bridge.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "cdns,mhdp",
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers,
 - clocks: DP bridge clock, it's used by the IP to know how to translate
	   a number of clock cycles into a time (which is used to comply
	   with DP standard timings and delays),
 - clock-names: must be "clk",

Required subnodes:
 - ports: Ports as described in Documentation/devictree/bindings/graph.txt
   Currently contains a single input port at address 0 representing the DPI
   input.
   Port 0 should be connected to a DPI encoder output.

Example:

	mhdp: mhdp@0xf0fb000000 {
		compatible = "cdns,mhdp";
		reg = <0xf0 0xfb000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
		clocks = <&mhdp_clock>;
		clock-names = "clk";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				mhdp0_dpi_input: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&xxx_dpi_output>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
