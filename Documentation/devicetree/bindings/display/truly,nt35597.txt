Truly model NT35597 1440x2560 DSI Panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "truly,nt35597"
- vdda-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  Power IC supply
- vdispp-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for positive LCD bias
- vdispn-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for negative LCD bias
- reset-gpios: phandle of gpio for reset line
  This should be 8mA, gpio can be configured using mux, pinctrl, pinctrl-names
- mode-gpios: phandle of the gpio for choosing the mode of the display
  for single DSI or Dual DSI
  This should be low for dual DSI and high for single DSI mode
- display-timings: Node for the Panel timings
- ports: This device has two video ports driven by two DSIs. Their connections
  are modelled using the OF graph bindings specified in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
  - port@0: DSI input port driven by master DSI
  - port@1: DSI input port driven by secondary DSI
