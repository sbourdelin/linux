Rockchip RV1108 RGB interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: matching the soc type:
	- "rockchip,rv1108-rgb";

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names: must contain a "lcdc" entry.
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this interface.

The rgb has two video ports described by:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
Their connections are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- video port 0 for the VOP input, the remote endpoint maybe vopb/vopl/vop
- video port 1 for either a panel or subsequent encoder

the panel described by:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/simple-panel.txt
rgb-mode nodes described by:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/panel-rgb.txt
Panel other required properties:
- ports for remote rgb output.

Example:

panel: panel {
	compatible = "auo,b101ean01";
	enable-gpios = <&gpio7 21 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	rgb-mode = "p888";

	ports {
		panel_in_rgb: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&rgb_out_panel>;
		};
	};
};

For Rockchip RV1108:

	rgb: rgb {
		compatible = "rockchip,rv1108-rgb";
		pinctrl-names = "lcdc";
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcdc_ctl>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			rgb_in: port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				rgb_in_vop: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vop_out_rgb>;
				};
			};

			rgb_out: port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				rgb_out_panel: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&panel_in_rgb>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
