Device tree configuration for PECI buses on the AST24XX and AST25XX SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible        : Should be one of:
			"aspeed,ast2400-peci"
			"aspeed,ast2500-peci"
- reg               : Should contain PECI controller registers location and
		      length.
- #address-cells    : Should be <1> required to define a client address.
- #size-cells       : Should be <0> required to define a client address.
- interrupts        : Should contain PECI controller interrupt.
- clocks            : Should contain clock source for PECI controller. Should
		      reference the external oscillator clock in the second
		      cell.
- resets            : Should contain phandle to reset controller with the reset
		      number in the second cell.
- clock-frequency   : Should contain the operation frequency of PECI controller
		      in units of Hz.
		      187500 ~ 24000000

Optional properties:
- msg-timing        : Message timing negotiation period. This value will
		      determine the period of message timing negotiation to be
		      issued by PECI controller. The unit of the programmed
		      value is four times of PECI clock period.
		      0 ~ 255 (default: 1)
- addr-timing       : Address timing negotiation period. This value will
		      determine the period of address timing negotiation to be
		      issued by PECI controller. The unit of the programmed
		      value is four times of PECI clock period.
		      0 ~ 255 (default: 1)
- rd-sampling-point : Read sampling point selection. The whole period of a bit
		      time will be divided into 16 time frames. This value will
		      determine the time frame in which the controller will
		      sample PECI signal for data read back. Usually in the
		      middle of a bit time is the best.
		      0 ~ 15 (default: 8)
- cmd-timeout-ms    : Command timeout in units of ms.
		      1 ~ 60000 (default: 1000)

Example:
	peci0: peci-bus@0 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-peci";
		reg = <0x0 0x60>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		interrupts = <15>;
		clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_REFCLK>;
		resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_PECI>;
		clock-frequency = <24000000>;
		msg-timing = <1>;
		addr-timing = <1>;
		rd-sampling-point = <8>;
		cmd-timeout-ms = <1000>;
	};
