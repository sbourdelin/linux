Device tree configuration for PECI buses on the AST24XX and AST25XX SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible
	"aspeed,ast2400-peci" or "aspeed,ast2500-peci"
	- aspeed,ast2400-peci: Aspeed AST2400 family PECI controller
	- aspeed,ast2500-peci: Aspeed AST2500 family PECI controller

- reg
	Should contain PECI registers location and length.

- #address-cells
	Should be <1>.

- #size-cells
	Should be <0>.

- interrupts
	Should contain PECI interrupt.

- clocks
	Should contain clock source for PECI hardware module. Should reference
	clkin clock.

- clock_frequency
	Should contain the operation frequency of PECI hardware module.
	187500 ~ 24000000

Optional properties:
- msg-timing-nego
	Message timing negotiation period. This value will determine the period
	of message timing negotiation to be issued by PECI controller. The unit
	of the programmed value is four times of PECI clock period.
	0 ~ 255 (default: 1)

- addr-timing-nego
	Address timing negotiation period. This value will determine the period
	of address timing negotiation to be issued by PECI controller. The unit
	of the programmed value is four times of PECI clock period.
	0 ~ 255 (default: 1)

- rd-sampling-point
	Read sampling point selection. The whole period of a bit time will be
	divided into 16 time frames. This value will determine which time frame
	this controller will sample PECI signal for data read back. Usually in
	the middle of a bit time is the best.
	0 ~ 15 (default: 8)

- cmd_timeout_ms
	Command timeout in units of ms.
	1 ~ 60000 (default: 1000)

Example:
	peci: peci@1e78b000 {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0x0 0x1e78b000 0x60>;

		peci0: peci-bus@0 {
			compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-peci";
			reg = <0x0 0x60>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <15>;
			clocks = <&clk_clkin>;
			clock-frequency = <24000000>;
			msg-timing-nego = <1>;
			addr-timing-nego = <1>;
			rd-sampling-point = <8>;
			cmd-timeout-ms = <1000>;
		};
