* Arcx anybus bridge

This chip communicates with the SoC over a parallel bus. It is
expected that its Device Tree node is specified as the child of a node
corresponding to the parallel bus used for communication.

Required properties:

  - compatible : The following chip-specific string:
        "arcx,anybus-bridge"

  - reg : bus memory area where the cpld registers are located.

  - reset-gpios : the GPIO pin connected to the reset line of the bridge.

  - #reset-cells : Must be 1.
	this bridge is a reset provider to its two embedded Anybus-S slots.

Example of usage:

This example places the bridge on top of the i.MX WEIM parallel bus, see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/bus/imx-weim.txt

&weim {
	anybus_bridge: bridge@0,0 {
		compatible = "arcx,anybus-bridge";
		reg = <0 0 0x100>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio5 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		/* fsl,weim-cs-timing is a i.MX WEIM bus specific property */
		fsl,weim-cs-timing = <0x024400b1 0x00001010 0x20081100
				0x00000000 0xa0000240 0x00000000>;
	};
};
