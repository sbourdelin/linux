Aspeed Watchdog Timer

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be one of:
	- "aspeed,ast2400-wdt"
	- "aspeed,ast2500-wdt"

 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region

Optional properties:
   Signal behavior - Whenever a timeout occurs, the watchdog can be programmed
   to generate 6 types of signals:

 - aspeed,arm-reset:  If property is present then reset ARM CPU only.

 - aspeed,soc-reset:  If property is present then reset SOC.

 - aspeed,sys-reset:  If property is present then reset the entire chip.
                      In cases where one of the other watchdog engines
                      in the system is responsible for system reset it
                      may be required to not specify this property.

 - aspeed,interrupt:  If property is present then interrupt CPU.

 - aspeed,external-signal: If property is present then signal is sent to
                           external reset counter (only WDT1 and WDT2).
 - aspeed,alt-boot:    If property is present then boot from alternate block.

Example:

	wdt1: watchdog@1e785000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-wdt";
		reg = <0x1e785000 0x1c>;
		aspeed,arm-reset;
		aspeed,soc-reset;
		aspeed,sys-reset;
		aspeed,interrupt;
		aspeed,external-signal;
		aspeed,alt-boot;
	};
