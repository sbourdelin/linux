Aspeed Watchdog Timer

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be one of:
	- "aspeed,ast2400-wdt"
	- "aspeed,ast2500-wdt"

 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region

Optional properties:
   Signal behavior - Whenever a timeout occurs the watchdog can be programmed
   to generate/not generate 6 types of signals:

 - aspeed,arm-reset:	If property is present then reset ARM CPU only.
			If not specified no ARM CPU reset is done.

 - aspeed,no-soc-reset: If property is present then do not reset SOC.
			If not specified then SOC reset is done.

 - aspeed,no-sys-reset: If property is present then do not reset system.
			Typcally used in tandem with 'aspeed-external-signal'
			If not specified then system reset is done.

 - aspeed,interrupt:	If property is present then interrupt CPU.
			If not specified then don't interrupt CPU.

 - aspeed,external-signal: If property is present then signal is sent to
			external reset counter (only WDT1 and WDT2). If not
			specified no external signal is sent.
 - aspeed,alt-boot:    If property is present then boot from alternate block.

Example:

	wdt1: watchdog@1e785000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-wdt";
		reg = <0x1e785000 0x1c>;
		aspeed,no-sys-reset;
		aspeed,external-signal;
	};
