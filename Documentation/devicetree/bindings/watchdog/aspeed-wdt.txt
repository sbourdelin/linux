Aspeed Watchdog Timer

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be one of:
	- "aspeed,ast2400-wdt"
	- "aspeed,ast2500-wdt"

 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region

Optional properties:
 - external-signal: If the property is present then an external signal is to
   be generated on watchdog timeout.  If absent, external signal is not
   generated.

 - no-system-reset: If the property is present then system will not be reset
   on watchdog timeout. In this case one of the other watchdogs will handle
   reset.  If absent then the watchdog resets the system on timeout.

Example:

	wdt1: watchdog@1e785000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-wdt";
		reg = <0x1e785000 0x1c>;
		external-signal;
		no-system-reset;
	};
