Basic single-register reset controller
======================================

This describes a generic reset controller where the reset lines are controlled
by single bits within a 32-bit memory location. The memory location is assumed
to be part of a syscon regmap.

By default the bit will be cleared on deassert. This behaviour can be inverted
with the assert-on-clear property mentioned below.

The bits are assumed to not be auto-clearing, and therefore can be read back to
determine the status.

Reset controller required properties:
 - compatible: should be "reset-basic"
 - #reset-cells: must be set to 1
 - reg: reset register location within regmap

Reset controller optional properties:
 - assert-on-clear: add this property when the hardware should clear (set to 0)
   the bit should to assert the reset.
   When this property is omitted the default is to set the bit to assert the
   reset

Device node required properties:
 - resets phandle
 - bit number, counting from zero, for the desired reset line. Max is 31.

Example:

syscon {
	compatible = "syscon";

	uart_reset: reset-controller@c {
		compatible = "reset-basic";
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xc>;
	};
}

&uart {
	resets = <&uart_rest 4>;
}
