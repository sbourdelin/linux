Basic single-register reset controller
======================================

This describes a generic reset controller where the reset lines are controlled
by single bits within a 32-bit memory location. The memory location is assumed
to be part of a syscon regmap.

Reset controller required properties:
 - compatible: should be "reset-basic"
 - #reset-cells: must be set to 1
 - reg: reset register location within regmap

Device node required properties:
 - resets phandle
 - bit number, counting from zero, for the desired reset line. Max is 31.

Example:

syscon {
	compatible = "syscon";

	uart_rest: rest@0c {
		compatible = "reset-basic";
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0c>;
	};
}

&uart {
	resets = <&uart_rest 0x04>;
}
