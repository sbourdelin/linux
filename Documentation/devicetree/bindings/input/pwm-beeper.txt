* PWM beeper device tree bindings

Registers a PWM device as beeper.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "pwm-beeper"
- pwms: phandle to the physical PWM device

Optional properties:
- volume-levels: Array of PWM duty cycle values that correspond to
      linear volume levels. These need to be in the range of 0 to 500,
      while 0 means 0% duty cycle (mute) and 500 means 50% duty cycle
      (max volume).
      Please note that the actual volume of most beepers is highly
      non-linear, which means that low volume levels are probably somewhere
      in the range of 1 to 30 (0.1-3% duty cycle).
- default-volume-level: the default volume level (index into the
      array defined by the "volume-levels" property)

Example:

	pwm-beeper {
		compatible = "pwm-beeper";
		pwms = <&pwm4 0 5000>;
		volume-levels = <0 8 20 40 500>;
		default-volume-level = <4>;
	};
