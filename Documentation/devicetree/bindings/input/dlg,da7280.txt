Dialog Semiconductor DA7280 Haptics bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "dlg,da7280".
- reg: Specifies the I2C slave address.

- interrupt-parent : Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to
  which the IRQs from DA7280 are delivered to.

- dlg,vib-mode:
  "LRA-MODE" - Linear Resonance Actuator mode.
  "ERM-BAR" - Bar type Eccentric Rotating Mass mode.
  "ERM-COIN" - Coin type Eccentric Rotating Mass mode.

- dlg,op-mode: Haptic operation mode.
  Possible values:
	1 - Direct register override mode triggered by i2c(default),
	2 - PWM data source mode setting duty to 0 - 0xffff(0% - 100%),
	3 - Register triggered waveform memory mode, the pattern assigned
	    to the PS_SEQ_ID played as much times as PS_SEQ_LOOP,
	4 - Edge triggered waveform memory mode, external GPI(N) condtrol
	    are required to enable/disable and it needs to keep
	    device enabled by sending magnitude (X > 0),
	    the pattern is assigned to the GPI(N)_SEQUENCE_ID below
	    For more details, please see the datasheet.

- dlg,nom-microvolt: Nominal actuator voltage rating.
  Valid values: 0 - 6000000.
- dlg,abs-max-microvolt: Absolute actuator maximum voltage rating.
  Valid values: 0 - 6000000.
- dlg,imax-microamp: Actuator max current rating.
  Valid values: 0 - 252000.
  Default: 130000.
- dlg,impd-micro-ohms: the impedance of the actuator in micro ohm,
  as read from its datasheet.
  Valid values: 0 - 1500000000.

Optional properties:
- pwms : phandle to the physical PWM(Pulse Width Modulation) device.
  PWM properties should be named "pwms". And number of cell is different
  for each pwm device.
  (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
   for further information relating to pwm properties)

- dlg,ps-seq-id: the PS_SEQ_ID(pattern ID in waveform memory inside chip)
  to play back when RTWM-MODE is enabled.
  Valid range: 0 - 15.
- dlg,ps-seq-loop: the PS_SEQ_LOOP, Number of times the pre-stored sequence
  pointed to by PS_SEQ_ID or GPI(N)_SEQUENCE_ID is repeated.
  Valid range: 0 - 15.
- dlg,gpiN-seq-id: the GPI(N)_SEQUENCE_ID, pattern to play
  when gpi0 is triggered, 'N' must be 0 - 2.
  Valid range: 0 - 15.
- dlg,gpiN-mode: the pattern mode which can select either
  "Single-pattern" or "Multi-pattern", 'N' must be 0 - 2.
- dlg,gpiN-polarity: gpiN polarity which can be chosen among
  "Rising-edge", "Falling-edge" and "Both-edge",
  'N' must be 0 - 2
  Haptic will work by this edge option in case of ETWM-MODE.

- dlg,resonant-freq-hz: use in case of LRA-MODE.
  the frequency range: 50 - 300.
  Default: 205.

- dlg,bemf-sens-enable: Enable for internal loop computations.
- dlg,freq-track-enable: Enable for resonant frequency tracking.
- dlg,acc-enable: Enable for active acceleration.
- dlg,rapid-stop-enable: Enable for rapid stop.
- dlg,amp-pid-enable: Enable for the amplitude PID.
- dlg,mem-array: use in case that memory registers should be updated,
  Please fill the whole buffers(100 bytes) to avoid any error in driver.
  For example,
	dlg,mem-array = <
		0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0A
		...
		0x71 0x72 0x73 0x74 0x75 0x76 0x77 0x78 0x79 0x7A
		0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
		0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
