MediaTek MT6397/MT6323 PMIC Keys Device Driver

There are two key functions provided by MT6397/MT6323 PMIC, pwrkey
and homekey. The key functions are defined as the subnode of the function
node provided by MT6397/MT6323 PMIC that is being defined as one kind
of Muti-Function Device (MFD)

For MT6397/MT6323 MFD bindings see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt6397-keys" or "mediatek,mt6323-keys"
- linux,keycodes: Specifies the numeric keycode values to
	be used for reporting keys presses. The array can
	contain up to 2 entries.

Optional Properties:
- mediatek,wakeup-keys: Specifies each key can be used as a wakeup source
	or not. This can be customized depends on board design.
- wakeup-source: PMIC keys can be used as wakeup sources.
- mediatek,long-press-mode: Long press key shutdown setting, 1 for
	pwrkey only, 2 for pwrkey/homekey together, others for disabled.
- debounce-interval: Long press key shutdown debouncing interval time
	in seconds. 0/1/2/3 for 8/11/14/5 seconds. If not specified defaults to 0.

Example:

	pmic: mt6397 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6397";

		...

		mt6397keys: mt6397keys {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6397-keys";
			linux,keycodes = <116>, <114>;
			mediatek,wakeup-keys = <1>, <0>;
			wakeup-source;
			mediatek,long-press-mode = <1>;
			debounce-interval = <0>;
		};
	};
