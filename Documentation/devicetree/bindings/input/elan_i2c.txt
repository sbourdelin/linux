- reg: I2C address of the chip.
- interrupt-parent: a phandle for the interrupt controller (see interrupt
  binding[0]).
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected (see interrupt
  binding[0]).

Optional properties:
- wakeup-source: touchpad can be used as a wakeup source.

- elan,max_x: the maximum reported value on the X axis
- elan,max_y: the maximum reported value on the Y axis
- elan,min_x: the minimum reported value on the X axis
- elan,min_y: the minimum reported value on the Y axis
- elan,x_res: the resolution of the X axis (in units per mm)
- elan,y_res: the resolution of the Y axis (in units per mm)
- elan,width: max reported width of a blob
