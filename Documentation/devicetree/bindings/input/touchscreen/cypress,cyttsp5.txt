* Cypress cyttsp touchscreen controller, generation 5

Required properties:
 - compatible		: must be "cypress,cyttsp5"
 - reg			: Device I2C address or SPI chip select number
 - interrupt-parent	: the phandle for the gpio controller
			  (see interrupt binding[0]).
 - interrupts		: (gpio) interrupt to which the chip is connected
			  (see interrupt binding[0]).

Optional properties:
 - reset-gpios		: the reset gpio the chip is connected to
			  (see GPIO binding[1] for more details).
Some other touchscreen optional properties can be defined such as
"touchscreen-size-x". See ./touchscreen.txt[2] for more details.

This touchscreen can handle some buttons that are touchscreen's defined zones.
Each button's event can be customized using a property:
	- linux,keycodes: List of keycode to emit.
