* Cypress cyttsp touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible		: must be "cypress,cyttsp-i2c" or "cypress,cyttsp-spi"
- reg			: Device I2C address or SPI chip select number
- spi-max-frequency 	: Maximum SPI clocking speed of the device (for cyttsp-spi)
- interrupt-parent	: the phandle for the gpio controller
			  (see interrupt binding[0]).
- interrupts		: (gpio) interrupt to which the chip is connected
			  (see interrupt binding[0]).
- reset-gpios		: the reset gpio the chip is connected to
			  (see GPIO binding[1] for more details).
- touchscreen-size-x	: horizontal resolution of touchscreen (in pixels)
- touchscreen-size-y	: vertical resolution of touchscreen (in pixels)
- bootloader-key	: the 8-byte bootloader key that is required to switch
			  the chip from bootloader mode (default mode) to
			  application mode.
			  This property has to be specified as an array of 8
			  '/bits/ 8' values.

Optional properties:
- active-distance	: the distance in pixels beyond which a touch must move
			  before movement is detected and reported by the device.
			  Valid values: 0-15.
- active-interval-ms	: the minimum period in ms between consecutive
			  scanning/processing cycles when the chip is in active mode.
			  Valid values: 0-255.
- lowpower-interval-ms	: the minimum period in ms between consecutive
			  scanning/processing cycles when the chip is in low-power mode.
			  Valid values: 0-2550
- touch-timeout-ms	: minimum time in ms spent in the active power state while no
			  touches are detected before entering low-power mode.
			  Valid values: 0-2550
