Atmel PTC Subsystem

The Atmel Peripheral Touch Controller subsystem offers built-in hardware
for capacitive touch measurement on sensors that function as buttons, sliders
and wheels.

1) PTC Subsystem node

Required properties:
- compatible: 		Must be "atmel,sama5d2-ptc"
- reg: 			Address, length of the shared memory and ppp registers location
			and length.
- clocks: 		Phandlers to the clocks.
- clock-names: 		Must be "ptc_clk", "ptc_int_osc", "slow_clk".
- #address-cells:	Must be one. The cell is the button or scroller id.
- #size-cells: 		Must be zero.

Example:
	ptc@fc060000 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-ptc";
		reg = <0x00800000 0x10000
		       0xfc060000 0xcf>;
		interrupts = <58 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 7>;
		clocks = <&ptc_clk>, <&main>, <&clk32k>;
		clock-names = "ptc_clk", "ptc_int_osc", "slow_clk";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		[ child node definitions... ]
	};

2) Scroller / buttons subnodes

Subnodes describe the kind of sensors the customer want to use. They have to be
named according to their function: button, slider or wheel.

2.1) Scroller subnodes

Required properties:
- reg:	Id of the scroller, each id must be different.

Example:
	slider@0 {
		reg = <0>;
	};

	wheel@1 {
		reg = <1>;
	};

2.2) Button subnodes

Required properties:
- reg:			Id of node used for the button, each id must be
			different.
- linux,keycode: 	Key code of the button.

Example:
		button@8 {
			reg = <8>;
			linux,keycode = <2>;
		};

		button@9 {
			reg = <9>;
			linux,keycode = <3>;
		};
