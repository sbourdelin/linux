* PTN5150 CC logic device
PTN5150A is a small thin low power CC Logic chip supporting the USB Type-C
connector application with Configuration Channel (CC) control logic detection and
indication functions. It is Interfaced to the host controller using an I2C interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nxp,ptn5150"
- reg: Specifies the I2C slave address of the device
- int-gpio: GPIO to which INTB is connected
- vbus-gpio: GPIO which controls VBUS on/off

Example:
		ptn5150@1d  {
			compatible = "nxp,ptn5150";
			reg = <0x1d>;
			int-gpio = <&msmgpio 78 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			vbus-gpio = <&msmgpio 148 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&ptn5150_default>;
			status = "okay";
		};
