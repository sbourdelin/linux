*Generic UIO platform driver with interrupts

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be a value set with the of_id module parameter.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt to be associated with this device
  (only a single interrupt is supported per device).
- interrupt-parent: Specifies the phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
- reg: Should specify the physical address spaces used by this device.

Example:

/* Device with MM IO and interrupt assuming of_id="me,my-device" */
my-device@10000 {
	compatible = "me,my-device";
	reg = <0x10000 0x40>;
	interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
};

/* Device with interrupt only assuming of_id="me,my-device" */
my-int {
	compatible = "me,my-device";
	interrupts = <6 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
};
