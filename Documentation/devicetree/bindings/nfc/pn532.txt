NXP PN532 NFC Chip

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be
    - "nxp,pn532" Place a node with this inside the devicetree node of the bus
                  where the NFC chip is connected to.
                  Currently the kernel has phy bindings for uart and i2c.
    - "nxp,pn532-i2c" (DEPRECATED) only works for the i2c binding.
    - "nxp,pn533-i2c" (DEPRECATED) only works for the i2c binding.

Required properties if connected on i2c:
- reg: for the i2c bus address. This is fixed at 0x48 for the PN532.

Example uart:

uart4: serial@49042000 {
        compatible = "ti,omap3-uart";

        pn532: nfc {
                compatible = "nxp,pn532";
        };
};

Example i2c:

i2c1: i2c@0 {
        compatible = "ti,omap3-i2c";

        pn532: nfc {
                compatible = "nxp,pn532";
                reg = <0x48>;
        };
};
