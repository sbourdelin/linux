SiFive PWM controller

Unlike most other PWM controllers, the SiFive PWM controller currently only
supports one period for all channels in the PWM. This is set globally in DTS.
The period also has significant restrictions on the values it can achieve,
which the driver rounds to the nearest achievable frequency.
PWM RTL that corresponds to the IP block version numbers can be found
here:

https://github.com/sifive/sifive-blocks/tree/master/src/main/scala/devices/pwm

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "sifive,$socname-pwm" and "sifive,pwmX".
  Please refer to sifive-blocks-ip-versioning.txt for details.
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: Should contain a clock identifier for the PWM's parent clock.
- #pwm-cells: Should be 2.
  The first cell is the PWM channel number
  The second cell is the PWM polarity
- sifive,period-ns: the driver will get as close to this period as it can
- interrupts: one interrupt per PWM channel

Examples:

pwm:  pwm@10020000 {
	compatible = "sifive,fu540-c000-pwm", "sifive,pwm0";
	reg = <0x0 0x10020000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&tlclk>;
	interrupt-parent = <&plic>;
	interrupts = <42 43 44 45>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	sifive,period-ns = <1000000>;
};
