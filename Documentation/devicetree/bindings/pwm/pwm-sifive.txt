SiFive PWM controller

Unlike most other PWM controllers, the SiFive PWM controller currently only
supports one period for all channels in the PWM. This is set globally in DTS.
The period also has significant restrictions on the values it can achieve,
which the driver rounds to the nearest achievable frequency.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be something similar to "sifive,<chip>-pwm" for
	      the PWM as integrated on a particular chip, and
	      "sifive,pwm<version>" for the general PWM IP block
	      programming model. Supported compatible strings are:
	      "sifive,fu540-c000-pwm" for the SiFive PWM v0 as
	      integrated onto the SiFive FU540 chip, and "sifive,pwm0"
	      for the SiFive PWM v0 IP block with no chip integration
	      tweaks.
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: The frequency the controller runs at
- #pwm-cells: Should be 2.
  The first cell is the PWM channel number
  The second cell is the PWM polarity
- sifive,approx-period: the driver will get as close to this period as it can
- interrupts: one interrupt per PWM channel

PWM RTL that corresponds to the IP block version numbers can be found

Further information on the format of the IP
block-specific version numbers can be found in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sifive/sifive-blocks-ip-versioning.txt

Examples:

pwm:  pwm@10020000 {
	compatible = "sifive,fu540-c000-pwm","sifive,pwm0";
	reg = <0x0 0x10020000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&tlclk>;
	interrupt-parent = <&plic>;
	interrupts = <42 43 44 45>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	sifive,approx-period = <1000000>;
};
