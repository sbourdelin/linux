SiFive PWM controller

Unlike most other PWM controllers, the SiFive PWM controller currently only
supports one period for all channels in the PWM. This is set globally in DTS.
The period also has significant restrictions on the values it can achieve,
which the driver rounds to the nearest achievable frequency.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of
	"sifive,fu540-c000-pwm0","sifive,pwm0".
	PWM controller is HiFive Unleashed specific chip which warrants a
	specific compatible string. The second string is kept for backward
	compatibility until a firmware update with latest compatible string.
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- clocks: The frequency the controller runs at
- #pwm-cells: Should be 2.
  The first cell is the PWM channel number
  The second cell is the PWM polarity
- sifive,approx-period: the driver will get as close to this period as it can
- interrupts: one interrupt per PWM channel (currently unused in the driver)

Examples:

pwm:  pwm@10020000 {
	compatible = "sifive,fu540-c000-pwm0","sifive,pwm0";
	reg = <0x0 0x10020000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&tlclk>;
	interrupt-parent = <&plic>;
	interrupts = <42 43 44 45>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	sifive,approx-period = <1000000>;
};
