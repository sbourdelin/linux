Device-Tree bindings for Atmel's LCDC (LCD Controller) PWM driver

The Atmel LCDC PWM is subdevice of the LCDC MFD device.
See ../mfd/atmel-lcdc.txt for more details.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be one of the following:
   "atmel,lcdc-pwm"
 - pinctr-names: the pin control state names. Should contain "default".
 - pinctrl-0: should contain the pinctrl states described by pinctrl
   default.
 - #pwm-cells: should be set to 3. This PWM chip use the default 3 cells
   bindings defined in pwm.txt in this directory.

Example:
	lcdc0: lcdc@700000 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9263-lcdc-mfd";
		reg = <0x700000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 3>;
		clocks = <&lcd_clk>, <&lcd_clk>;
		clock-names = "lcdc_clk", "hclk";

		lcdc_pwm: lcdc-pwm {
			compatible = "atmel,lcdc-pwm";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_lcdc_pwm>;
			#pwm-cells = <3>;
		};

	};
