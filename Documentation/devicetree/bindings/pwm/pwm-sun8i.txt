Allwinner sun8i R40/V40/T3 SoC PWM controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be one of:
    - "allwinner,sun8i-r40-pwm"
  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
  - #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
    the cells format.
  - clocks: From common clock binding, handle to the parent clock.

Example:

pwm: pwm@1c23400 {
	     compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-pwm";
	     reg = <0x01c23400 0x154>;
	     clocks = <&osc24M>;
	     #pwm-cells = <3>;
};
