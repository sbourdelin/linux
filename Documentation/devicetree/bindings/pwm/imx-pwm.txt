Freescale i.MX PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "fsl,<soc>-pwm" and one of the following
   compatible strings:
  - "fsl,imx1-pwm" for PWM compatible with the one integrated on i.MX1
  - "fsl,imx27-pwm" for PWM compatible with the one integrated on i.MX27
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: 2 for i.MX1 and 3 for i.MX27 and newer SoCs. See pwm.txt
  in this directory for a description of the cells format.
- clocks : Clock specifiers for both ipg and per clocks.
- clock-names : Clock names should include both "ipg" and "per"
See the clock consumer binding,
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- interrupts: The interrupt for the pwm controller

Optional properties:
- pinctrl: For i.MX27 and newer SoCs. Add extra pinctrl to configure the PWM
  pin to gpio function.  It allows control over the pin output level when the
  PWM block is disabled. This is meant to be used if inverted polarity of the
  PWM signal is required. See "Inverted PWM output" section bellow.

Example:

pwm1: pwm@53fb4000 {
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-pwm", "fsl,imx27-pwm";
	reg = <0x53fb4000 0x4000>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX5_CLK_PWM1_IPG_GATE>,
		 <&clks IMX5_CLK_PWM1_HF_GATE>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
	interrupts = <61>;
};

Inverted PWM output
-------------------

The i.MXÂ SoC has such limitation that whenever a pad is configured as a PWM
output, the output level is always zero volts when the PWM block is disabled.
The zero output level is actively driven by the output stage of the PWM block
and can not be overridden by pull-up. It also does not matter what PWM polarity
a PWM client (e.g. backlight) requested.

To gain control of the PWM output level in disabled state two pinctrl states
can be used. The "default" state and the "pwm" state. In the default state the
PWM output is configured as a GPIO with pull-up. In the "pwm" state the output
is configured as a PWM output. This setup assures that the PWM output is at
the required level that corresponds to duty cycle = 0 when PWM is disabled.
E.g. at boot.

Example:

&pwm1 {
	pinctrl-names = "default", "pwm";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_backlight_gpio>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_backlight_pwm>;
}

pinctrl_backlight_gpio: pwm1grp-gpio {
	fsl,pins = <
		/* GPIO with 22kOhm pull-up */
		MX6QDL_PAD_GPIO_9__GPIO1_IO09	0xF008
	>;
};

pinctrl_backlight_pwm: pwm1grp-pwm {
	fsl,pins = <
		/* PWM output */
		MX6QDL_PAD_GPIO_9__PWM1_OUT	0x8
	>;
};
