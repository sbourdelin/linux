Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. LPG driver specific bindings

This binding document describes the properties of LPG (Light Pulse Generator)
device module in Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC chips.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must be "qcom,pwm-lpg".

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Register base and length for LPG modules. The length
		      varies based on the number of channels available in
		      the PMIC chips.

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: The name of the register defined in the reg property.
		      It must be "lpg-base".

- #pwm-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The number of cells in "pwms" property specified in
		      PWM user nodes. It should be 2. The first cell is
		      the PWM channel ID indexed from 0, and the second
		      cell is the PWM default period in nanoseconds.

Example:

	pmi8998_lpg: lpg@b100 {
		compatible = "qcom,pwm-lpg";
		reg = <0xb100 0x600>;
		reg-names = "lpg-base";
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
	};
