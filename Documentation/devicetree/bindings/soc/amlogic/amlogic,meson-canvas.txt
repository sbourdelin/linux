Amlogic Meson Canvas
================================

A canvas is a collection of metadata that describes a pixel buffer.
Those metadata include: width, height, phyaddr, wrapping, block mode
and endianness.

Many IPs within Amlogic SoCs rely on canvas indexes to read/write pixel data
rather than use the phy addresses directly. For instance, this is the case for
the video decoders and the display.

Amlogic SoCs have 256 canvas.

Canvas Provider
--------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: "amlogic,meson-canvas"

Parent node should have the following properties :
- compatible: "amlogic,meson-gx-dmc-sysctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd"
- reg: base address and size of the DMC system control register space.

Example:

sysctrl_DMC: system-controller@0 {
	compatible = "amlogic,meson-gx-dmc-sysctrl", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x1000>;

	canvas: canvas-provider@0 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-canvas";
	};
};
