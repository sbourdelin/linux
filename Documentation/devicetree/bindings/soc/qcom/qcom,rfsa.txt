Qualcomm Remote File System Access binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm RFSA, which serves the purpose of managing
the shared memory region used for remote processors to access block device data
using the Remote Filesystem protocol.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be:
		    "qcom,rfsa"

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: handle to memory reservation the associated rfsa region.

- qcom,client-id:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: identifier of the client to use this region for buffers.

= EXAMPLE
The following example shows the RFSA setup for APQ8016, with the RFSA region
for the Hexagon DSP (id #1) located at 0x86700000.

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		rmtfs: rmtfs@86700000 {
			reg = <0x0 0x86700000 0x0 0xe0000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};

	hexagon-rfsa {
		compatible = "qcom,rfsa";
		memory-region = <&rmtfs>;

		qcom,client-id = <1>;
	};
