Qualcomm SLIMBus Non Generic Device (NGD) Controller binding

SLIMBus NGD controller is a light-weight driver responsible for communicating
with SLIMBus slaves directly over the bus using messaging interface and
communicating with master component residing on ADSP for bandwidth and
data-channel management

Please refer to slimbus/bus.txt for details of the common SLIMBus bindings.
