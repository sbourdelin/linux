Mediatek MT7623 PCIe controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "mediatek,mt7623-pcie".
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- reg: Base addresses and lengths of the pcie controller.
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller.
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
  - cell 0 specifies the bus and device numbers of the root port:
    [23:16]: bus number
    [15:11]: device number
  - cell 1 denotes the upper 32 address bits and should be 0
  - cell 2 contains the lower 32 address bits and is used to translate to the
    CPU address space
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - free_ck
- power-domains: A phandle and power domain specifier pair to the power domain
  which is responsible for collapsing and restoring power to the peripheral
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller
- ranges: Describes the translation of addresses for root ports and standard
  PCI regions. The entries must be 6 cells each, where the first three cells
  correspond to the address as described for the #address-cells property
  above, the fourth cell is the physical CPU address to translate to and the
  fifth and six cells are as described for the #size-cells property above.
  - The first three entries are expected to translate the addresses for the root
    port registers, which are referenced by the assigned-addresses property of
    the root port nodes (see below).
  - The remaining entries setup the mapping for the standard I/O and memory
	regions.
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.

In addition, the device tree node must have sub-nodes describing each
PCIe interface, having the following mandatory properties:

Required properties:
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- assigned-addresses: Address and size of the port configuration registers
- reg: Only the first four bytes are used to refer to the correct bus number
  and device number.
- #address-cells: Must be 3
- #size-cells: Must be 2
- ranges: Sub-ranges distributed from the PCIe controller node. An empty
  property is sufficient.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - sys_ck
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - pcie-reset
- num-lanes: Number of lanes to use for this port.
- phys: Must contain an entry for each entry in phy-names.
- phy-names: Must include an entry for each sub node. Entries are of the form
  "pcie-phyN": where N ranges from 0 to the value specified for port number.
  See ../phy/phy-mt7623-pcie.txt for details.
