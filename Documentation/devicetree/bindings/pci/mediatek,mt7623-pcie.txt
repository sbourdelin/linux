Mediatek Gen2 PCIe controller which is available on MT7623 series SoCs

PCIe subsys supports single root complex (RC) with 3 Root Ports. Each root
ports supports a Gen2 1-lane Link and has PIPE interface to PHY.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "mediatek,mt7623-pcie".
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- reg: Base addresses and lengths of the PCIe controller.
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
- interrupts: Three interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following names
  - "pcie-int0"
  - "pcie-int1"
  - "pcie-int2"
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - free_ck :for reference clock of PCIe subsys
  - sys_ck0 :for clock of Port0
  - sys_ck1 :for clock of Port1
  - sys_ck2 :for clock of Port2
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - pcie-rst0 :port0 reset
  - pcie-rst1 :port1 reset
  - pcie-rst2 :port2 reset
- phys: list of PHY specifiers (used by generic PHY framework).
- phy-names : must be "pcie-phy0", "pcie-phy1", "pcie-phyN".. based on the
  number of PHYs as specified in *phys* property.
- power-domains: A phandle and power domain specifier pair to the power domain
  which is responsible for collapsing and restoring power to the peripheral.
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller.
- ranges:
  - The first three entries are expected to translate the addresses for the root
    port registers, which are referenced by the assigned-addresses property of
    the root port nodes (see below).
  - The remaining entries setup the mapping for the standard I/O and memory
	regions.
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.

In addition, the device tree node must have sub-nodes describing each
PCIe port interface, having the following mandatory properties:

Required properties:
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- assigned-addresses: Address and size of the port configuration registers
- reg: Only the first four bytes are used to refer to the correct bus number
  and device number.
- #address-cells: Must be 3
- #size-cells: Must be 2
- #interrupt-cells: Must be 1
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- ranges: Sub-ranges distributed from the PCIe controller node. An empty
  property is sufficient.
- num-lanes: Number of lanes to use for this port.
