Mediatek Gen2 V1 PCIe controller

PCIe subsys supports single root complex (RC) with 3 Root Ports. Each root
ports supports a Gen2 1-lane Link. It includes one Host/PCI bridge and 3
PCIe MAC. Each port has PIPE interface to PHY. There are 3 bus master for
data access and 1 bus slave for Configuration and Status Register access.

This controller is available on MT7623 series SoCs.
  
Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "mediatek,gen2v1-pcie".
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- reg: Base addresses and lengths of the PCIe controller.
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
  - cell 0 specifies the bus and device numbers of the root port:
    [23:16]: bus number
    [15:11]: device number
  - cell 1 denotes the upper 32 address bits and should be 0
  - cell 2 contains the lower 32 address bits and is used to translate to the
    CPU address space
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
- interrupts: Three interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - free_ck	:for reference clock of PCIe subsys
  - sys_ck0	:for clock of Port0 MAC
  - sys_ck1	:for clock of Port1 MAC
  - sys_ck2	:for clock of Port2 MAC
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - pcie-rst0	:port0 reset
  - pcie-rst1	:port1 reset
  - pcie-rst2	:port2 reset
- phys: list of PHY specifiers (used by generic PHY framework)
- phy-names : must be "pcie-phy0", "pcie-phy1", "pcie-phyN".. based on the
  number of PHYs as specified in *phys* property.
- power-domains: A phandle and power domain specifier pair to the power domain
  which is responsible for collapsing and restoring power to the peripheral
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller
- ranges: Describes the translation of addresses for root ports and standard
  PCI regions. The entries must be 6 cells each, where the first three cells
  correspond to the address as described for the #address-cells property
  above, the fourth cell is the physical CPU address to translate to and the
  fifth and six cells are as described for the #size-cells property above.
  - The first three entries are expected to translate the addresses for the root
    port registers, which are referenced by the assigned-addresses property of
    the root port nodes (see below).
  - The remaining entries setup the mapping for the standard I/O and memory
	regions.
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.

In addition, the device tree node must have sub-nodes describing each
PCIe port interface, having the following mandatory properties:

Required properties:
- device_type: Must be "pci"
- assigned-addresses: Address and size of the port configuration registers
- reg: Only the first four bytes are used to refer to the correct bus number
  and device number.
- #address-cells: Must be 3
- #size-cells: Must be 2
- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- ranges: Sub-ranges distributed from the PCIe controller node. An empty
  property is sufficient.
- num-lanes: Number of lanes to use for this port.
