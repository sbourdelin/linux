EEPROMs (I2C)

Required properties:

  - compatible: must be a "<manufacturer>,<model>" pair with one of the
                following values as fallback:

                "atmel,24c00",
                "atmel,24c01",
                "atmel,24c02",
                "atmel,24c04",
                "atmel,24c08",
                "atmel,24c16",
                "atmel,24c32",
                "atmel,24c64",
                "atmel,24c128",
                "atmel,24c256",
                "atmel,24c512",
                "atmel,24c1024"

  - reg : the I2C address of the EEPROM

Optional properties:

  - pagesize : the length of the pagesize for writing. Please consult the
               manual of your device, that value varies a lot. A wrong value
	       may result in data loss! If not specified, a safety value of
	       '1' is used which will be very slow.

  - read-only: this parameterless property disables writes to the eeprom

  - size: total eeprom size in bytes

  - no-read-rollover:
			This parameterless property indicates that the multi-address
			eeprom does not automatically roll over reads to the next
			slave address. Please consult the manual of your device.

  - wp-gpios: GPIO to which the write-protect pin of the chip is connected.

Example:

eeprom@52 {
	compatible = "atmel,24c32";
	reg = <0x52>;
	pagesize = <32>;
	wp-gpios = <&gpio1 3 0>;
};
