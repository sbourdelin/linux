Mediatek Timers
---------------

Mediatek SoCs have two different timers on different platforms,
- GPT (General Purpose Timer)
- SYST (System Timer)

Please bind correct timers in each platforms.


** General Purpose Timer (GPT)

Required properties:
- compatible should contain:
	* "mediatek,mt2701-timer" for MT2701 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt6580-timer" for MT6580 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt6589-timer" for MT6589 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt7623-timer" for MT7623 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt8127-timer" for MT8127 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt8135-timer" for MT8135 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt8173-timer" for MT8173 compatible timers
	* "mediatek,mt6577-timer" for MT6577 and all above compatible timers
- reg: Should contain location and length for GPT register.
- clocks: GPT is drived by system clock.

Examples:

	timer@10008000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6577-timer";
		reg = <0x10008000 0x80>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 113 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&system_clk>;
	};


** System Timer (SYST)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain
	* "mediatek,mt6765-systimer" for MT6765 compatible timers
- reg: Should contain the location and length for system timer registers.
- clocks: System timer is drived by system clock.

Examples:

	systimer@10017000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6765-systimer";
		reg = <0 0x10017000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 194 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&system_clk>;
	};
