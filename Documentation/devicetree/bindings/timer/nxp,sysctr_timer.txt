NXP System Counter Module(sys_ctr)

The system counter(sys_ctr) is a programmable system counter which provides
a shared time base to Cortex A15, A7, A53, A73, etc. it is intended for use in
applications where the counter is always powered and support multiple,
unrelated clocks.

Required properties:

- compatible :      should be "nxp,sysctr-timer"
- reg :             Specifies the base physical address and size of the comapre
                    frame and the counter control, read & compare.
- interrupts :      should be the compare frames' interrupt
- clock-frequency : Specifies the counter clock frequency.

Example:

	system_counter: timer@306a0000 {
		compatible = "nxp,sysctr-timer";
		reg = <0x0 0x306a0000 0x0 0x10000>, /* system-counter-rd base */
		      <0x0 0x306b0000 0x0 0x10000>, /* system-counter-cmp base */
		      <0x0 0x306c0000 0x0 0x10000>; /* system-counter-ctrl base */
		clock-frequency = <8000000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 47 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			     <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
