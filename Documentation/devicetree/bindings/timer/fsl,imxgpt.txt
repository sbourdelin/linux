Freescale i.MX General Purpose Timer (GPT)

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "fsl,<soc>-gpt".
- reg : specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : should be the clock event device interrupt.
- clocks : the clocks provided by the SoC to drive the timer, must contain
           an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : must include an "per" or "osc_per" entry, and "ipg" entry
                is optional according to SoC design.

Example:

gpt: gpt@2098000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6sx-gpt", "fsl,imx31-gpt";
	reg = <0x02098000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_GPT_BUS>,
		 <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_GPT_3M>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
};
