Binding for the i.MX Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT)

The Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) is a 32-bit set-and-forget timer
that is capable of providing precise interrupts at regular intervals with
minimal processor intervention.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,<chip>-epit", "fsl,imx31-epit" where <chip> is
  imx25, imx6qdl, imx6sl, imx6sul or imx6sx.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: Should contain EPIT controller interrupt
- clocks : The clock provided by the SoC to drive the timer.

Example for i.MX6QDL:
	epit1: epit@20d0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6qdl-epit", "fsl,imx31-epit";
		reg = <0x020d0000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <0 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_EPIT1>;
	};
