Device-Tree bindings for ps2 gpio driver

Required properties:
	- compatible = "ps2-gpio";
	- gpios: data and clock gpio

Optional properties:
	- ps2-gpio,write-enable: Indicates whether write function is provided
	to serio device. Most probably providing the write fn will not work,
	because of the tough timing libps2 requires.

Example nodes:

ps2@0 {
	compatible = "ps2-gpio";
	gpios = <&gpio 24 0 /* data */
		 &gpio 23 0 /* clock */
		>;
	i2c-gpio,write-enable = <0>;
};
