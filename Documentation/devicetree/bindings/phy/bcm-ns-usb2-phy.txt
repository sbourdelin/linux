Driver for Broadcom Northstar USB 2.0 PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: brcm,ns-usb2-phy
- syscon-cru: phandle to the CRU (Central Resource Unit) syscon
- clocks: USB PHY reference clock
- clock-names: "phy-ref-clk", the only needed & supported clock right now

Deprecated:

PHY block should not claim the whole DMU so such a binding has been deprecated.
It only requires to access few CRU (a DMU subblock) registers and that should be
handled with a syscon since CRU is a MFD (Multi-Function Device).

- reg: iomem address range of DMU (Device Management Unit)
- reg-names: "dmu", the only needed & supported reg right now

To initialize USB 2.0 PHY driver needs to setup PLL correctly. To do this it
requires passing phandle to the USB PHY reference clock.

Example:
	dmu@1800c000 {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		ranges = <0 0x1800c000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		cru: cru@100 {
			compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
			reg = <0x100 0x1a4>;
		};
	};

	usb2-phy {
		compatible = "brcm,ns-usb2-phy";
		syscon-cru = <&cru>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&genpll BCM_NSP_GENPLL_USB_PHY_REF_CLK>;
		clock-names = "phy-ref-clk";
	};
