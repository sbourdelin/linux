Broadcom USB3 dual port phy for Northstar2 SoC
This is a child bus node of "brcm,mdio-mux-iproc" node.

Required mdio bus properties:
- reg: MDIO Bus number for the MDIO interface
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Required PHY properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-usb3-phy"
- reg: MDIO Phy ID for the MDIO interface
- #phy-cells: must be 0
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
 - reg: the PHY number
 - phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 0

Example:

mdio@1 {
	reg = <0x1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	usb3_phy: usb3_phy@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,ns2-usb3-phy";
		reg = <0x0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		usb3_phy0: usb3_phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			status = "disabled";
		};

		usb3_phy1: usb_phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			status = "disabled";
		};
	};
};
