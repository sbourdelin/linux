HiSilicon INNO USB2 PHY
-----------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings:
		"hisilicon,inno-usb2-phy",
		"hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy",
- #phy-cells: Must be 0
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: Phandle of syscon used to control phy.
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifier pair for reference clock utmi_refclk.
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs for each reset signal in
reset-names.
- reset-names: Should be "por_rst" and "test_rst". The test_rst only
exists in some of SOCs, so it is optional.

Phy node can include up to four subnodes. Each subnode represents one port.
The required properties of port node are as follows:
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifier pair for utmi_clock.
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs for port reset and utmi reset.
- reset-names: List of reset signal names. Should be "port_rst" and "utmi_rst"

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example:
usb_phy: phy {
		 compatible = "hisilicon,inno_usb2_phy";
		 #phy-cells = <0>;
		 hisilicon,peripheral-syscon = <&peri_ctrl>;
		 clocks = <&crg USB2_REF_CLK>;
		 resets = <&crg 0xb4 2>;
		 reset-names = "por_rst";
		 port0 {
			 clocks = <&crg USB2_UTMI0_CLK>;
			 resets = <&crg 0xb4 5>, <&crg 0xb4 1>;
			 reset-names = "port_rst", "utmi_rst";
		 };
	 };
