Mediatek MT7623 PCIe PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should contain "mediatek,mt7623-pcie-phy"
 - #phy-cells: must be 0
 - clocks: Must contain an entry in clock-names.
	See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
 - clock-names: Must be "refclk"
 - resets: Must contain an entry in reset-names.
	See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
 - reset-names: Must be "phy"

Optional properties:
 - phy-switch: The PHY on PCIe port2 is shared with USB u3phy2. If you
	want to enable port2, you should contain it.

Example:

	pcie0_phy: pciephy@1a149000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0 0x1a149000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk26m>;
		clock-names = "pciephya_ref";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

	pcie1_phy: pciephy@1a14a000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0 0x1a14a000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk26m>;
		clock-names = "pciephya_ref";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

	pcie2_phy: pciephy@1a244000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0 0x1a244000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk26m>;
		clock-names = "pciephya_ref";
		#phy-cells = <0>;

		phy-switch = <&hifsys>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Specifying phy control of devices
---------------------------------

Device nodes should specify the configuration required in their "phys"
property, containing a phandle to the phy node and phy-names.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/phy/phy.h>

pcie: pcie@1a140000 {
	...
	pcie@1,0 {
		...
		phys = <&pcie0_phy>;
		phy-names = "pcie-phy0";
	}
	...
};
