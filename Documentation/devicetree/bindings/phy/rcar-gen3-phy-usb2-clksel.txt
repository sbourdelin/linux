* Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 2.0 clock selector PHY

This file provides information on what the device node for the R-Car generation
3 USB 2.0 clock selector PHY contains.

If you connect an external clock to the USB_EXTAL pin, you can use the
"renesas,usb_extal_only" property for it.
If you connect an oscillator to both the USB_XTAL and USB_EXTAL, this module
is not needed because this is default setting.

Case 1: An external clock connects to R-Car SoC
	+----------+   +--- R-Car ---------------------+
	|External  |---|USB_EXTAL ---> all usb channels|
	|clock     |   |USB_XTAL                       |
	+----------+   +-------------------------------+
In this case, we need this driver with "usb-extal-only" property.

Case 2: An oscillator connects to R-Car SoC
	+----------+   +--- R-Car ---------------------+
	|Oscillator|---|USB_EXTAL -+-> all usb channels|
	|          |---|USB_XTAL --+                   |
	+----------+   +-------------------------------+
In this case, we don't need this selector.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,r8a7795-usb2-clksel-phy" if the device is a part of an
	      R8A7795 SoC.
	      "renesas,r8a7796-usb2-clksel-phy" if the device is a part of an
	      R8A7796 SoC.

	      When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	      SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	      followed by the generic version.

- reg: offset and length of the USB 2.0 clock selector register block.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair(s).
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <0>.

Optional properties:
- renesas,usb-extal-only: to connect a clock generator to USB_EXTAL pin.

Example (R-Car H3):

	usb2_clksel_phy: usb-phy@e6590630 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7795-usb2-clksel-phy",
			     "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb2-clksel-phy";
		reg = <0 0xe6590630 0 0x02>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 703>;
		renesas,usb-extal-only;
	};

	&ehci0 {
		/* We should set usb2_clksel_phy into the first phys prop */
		phys = <&usb2_clksel_phy>, <&usb2_phy0>;
		phy-names = "usb_clk", "usb";

		status = "okay";
	};
