Generic simple phy device tree binding
--------------------------------------

A good number of phy implementations merely read dts properties,
enable clocks, regulators or do resets without having a dedicated register
map. This binding implements a generic phy driver which can be used for
such simple implementations and avoid boilerplate code duplication.

Required Properties:
-  compatible	: must be "simple-phy"
-  phy-cells    : must be 0

Optional Properties:
-  bus-width	: generic bus-width. Must be positive.
-  max-bitrate	: generic max-bitrate. Must be positive.
-  pwr		: phandle to phy pwr regulator node.

Example:

The following example is a can transceiver implemented as a generic phy.
It has a max-bitrate property and a pwr regulator.


transceiver1: can-transceiver {
	compatible = "simple-phy";
	max-bitrate = <5000000>;
	pwr-supply = <&transceiver1_fixed>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
};
