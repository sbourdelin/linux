Cadence Sierra PHY
-----------------------

Required properties:
- compatible:	cdns,sierra-phy-t0
- clocks:	Must contain an entry in clock-names.
		See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names:	Must be "phy_clk"
- resets:	Must contain an entry for each in reset-names.
		See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names:	Must include "sierra_reset" and "sierra_apb" and one for each
		sub-node.
		"sierra_reset" must control the reset line to the PHY.
		"sierra_apb" must control the reset line to the APB PHY
		interface.
		Resets for each subnode must control the master lane for the
		subnode lane group.
- reg:		register range for the PHY.
- reg-names:	Must be "reg".
- #address-cells: Should be 1
- #size-cells:	Should be 0

Optional properties:
- cdns,autoconf:	If present, indicates that the PHY registers will
			be configured by hardware.  If not present, all
			sub-node optional properties must be provided.

Sub-nodes:
  Each group of PHY lanes with a single master lane should be represented as
  a sub-node. Note that the actual configuration of each lane is determined by
  hardware strapping, and must match the configuration specified here.

Sub-node required properties:
- #phy-cells:	Generic PHY binding; must be 0.

Sub-node optional properties:
- reg:			The master lane number.
- cdns,num-lanes:	Number of lanes in this group.  From 1 to 4.
- cdns,phy-type:	Can be PHY_TYPE_PCIE or PHY_TYPE_USB3, depending on
			configuration of lanes.

Example:
	pcie_phy4: pcie-phy4@fd240000 {
		compatible = "cdns,sierra-phy-t0";
		reg = <0x0 0xfd240000 0x0 0x40000>;
		reg-names = "reg";
		resets = <&phyrst 0>, <&phyrst 1>,<&phyrst 2>,<&phyrst 4>;
		reset-names = "sierra_reset","sierra_apb","pcie_phy0",pcie_phy1;
		clocks = <&phyclock>;
		clock-names = "phy_clk";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		pcie0_phy0: pcie-phy0@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				cdns,num-lanes = <2>;
				#phy-cells = <0>;
				cdns,phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_PCIE>;
		};
		pcie0_phy1: pcie-phy1@0 {
				reg = <2>;
				cdns,num-lanes = <1>;
				#phy-cells = <0>;
				cdns,phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_PCIE>;
		};
