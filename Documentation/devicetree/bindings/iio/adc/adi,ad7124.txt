Analog Devices AD7124 ADC device driver

Required properties for the AD7124:
	- compatible: Must be one of "adi,ad7124-4" or "adi,ad7124-8"
	- reg: SPI chip select number for the device
	- spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use
		see: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
	- clocks: phandle to the master clock (mclk)
		see: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
	- clock-names: Must be "mclk".
	- interrupts: IRQ line for the ADC
		see: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

	- adi,channels: List of external channels connected to the ADC:
	  Required properties:
		* #address-cells: Must be 2.
		* #size-cells: Must be 0.

	  The child nodes of this node represent the external channels which are
	  connected to the ADC.

	  Each child node represents one channel and has the following
	  properties:
		Required properties:
			* reg: Pins the channel is connected to. The first value specifies
			  the positive input pin, the second value the negative input pin.
			* adi,channel-number: It can have up to 4 channels on ad7124-4 and
			  8 channels on ad7124-8, numbered from 0 to 15.

		Optional properties:
			* adi,bipolar: If set the channel is used in bipolar mode.
			* adi,reference-select: Select the reference source to use when
			  converting on the the specific channel. Valid values are:
			  0: REFIN1(+)/REFIN1(−).
			  1: REFIN2(+)/REFIN2(−).
			  3: AVDD
			  If this field is left empty, internal reference is selected.
			* adi,gain: Select the gain when converting on the specific channel.
			  Valid values are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
			  If this field is left empty, gain of 1 is selected.
			* adi,odr-hz: The output data rate can be programmed from:
			  9 to 19200 for full power mode (when the master clock is 614.4 kHz)
			  2 to 4800 for mid power mode (when the master clock is 153.6 kHz)
			  1 to 2400 for low power mode (when the master clock is 76.8 kHz)
			  If this field is left empty, odr of 9 is selected.

Optional properties:
	- refin1-supply: refin1 supply can be used as reference for conversion.
	- refin2-supply: refin2 supply can be used as reference for conversion.
	- avdd-supply: avdd supply can be used as reference for conversion.

Example:
	adc@0 {
		compatible = "adi,ad7124-4";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <5000000>;
		interrupts = <25 2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		refin1-supply = <&adc_vref>;
		clocks = <&ad7124_mclk>;
		clock-names = "mclk";

		adi,channels {
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			channel@0 {
				reg = <0 1>;
				adi,channel-number = <0>;
				adi,reference-select = <0>;
				adi,gain = <2>;
				adi,odr-hz = <10>;
			};

			channel@1 {
				reg = <2 3>;
				adi,bipolar;
				adi,channel-number = <1>;
				adi,reference-select = <0>;
				adi,gain = <4>;
				adi,odr-hz = <50>;
			};

			channel@2 {
				reg = <4 5>;
				adi,channel-number = <2>;
				adi,gain = <128>;
				adi,odr-hz = <19200>;
			};

			channel@3 {
				reg = <6 7>;
				adi,channel-number = <3>;
			};
		};
	};
