* AVIA HX711 ADC chip for weight cells
  Bit-banging driver

Required properties:
 - compatible:	Should be "avia,hx711"
 - sck-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for the clock
 - dout-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for data-out
		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
 - avdd-supply:	Definition of the regulator used as analog supply

Optional properties:
 - avia,data-ready-delay-ns:	additional delay in nanoseconds between
				rising of PD_SCK until DOUT is ready
				should be less then maximum PD_SCK high
				time which is 50000 in the datasheet

Example:
weight {
	compatible = "avia,hx711";
	sck-gpios = <&gpio3 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	dout-gpios = <&gpio0 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	avdd-suppy = <&avdd>;
	avia,data-ready-delay-ns = <1000>;
};
