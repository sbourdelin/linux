Analog Devices AD7606 Simultaneous Sampling ADC

Required properties for the AD7606:

 - compatible: Must be one of "adi,ad7605-4", "adi,ad7606-8", "adi,ad7606-6" or
 	       "adi,ad7606-4".
 - reg: SPI chip select number for the device
 - spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use
 	see: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
 - spi-cpha: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
 - avcc-supply: phandle to the Avcc power supply
 - interrupts: IRQ line for the ADC
 	see: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
 - conversion-start-gpio: must be the device tree identifier of the CONVST pin.
			  This logic input is used to initiate conversions on
			  the analog input channels.

Optional properties:

 - reset-gpio: must be the device tree identifier of the RESET pin. If specified,
 	       it will be asserted during driver probe.
 - first-data-gpio: must be the device tree identifier of the FRSTDATA pin.
 		    The FRSTDATA output indicates when the first channel, V1, is
		    being read back on either the parallel, byte or serial interface.
- standby-gpio: must be the device tree identifier of the STBY pin. This pin is used
		to place the AD7606 into one of two power-down modes, Standby mode or
		Shutdown mode.
- range-gpio: must be the device tree identifier of the RANGE pin. The polarity on
	      this pin determines the input range of the analog input channels. If
	      this pin is tied to a logic high, the analog input range is ±10V for
	      allchannels. If this pin is tied to a logic low, the analog input range
	      is ±5V for all channels.

Example:

	adc@0 {
		compatible = "adi,ad7606-8";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
		spi-cpol;

		avcc-supply = <&adc_vref>;

		interrupts = <25 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;

		conversion-start-gpio = <&gpio 17 0>;
		reset-gpio = <&gpio 27 0>;
		first-data-gpio = <&gpio 22 0>;
		standby-gpio = <&gpio 24 0>;
	};
