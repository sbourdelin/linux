ST VL53L0X ToF ranging sensor

Required properties:
	- compatible: must be "st,vl53l0x-i2c"
	- reg: i2c address where to find the device

Optional properties:
	- interrupts : Interrupt line receiving GPIO1's measuring complete
	  output, supports IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING only.

	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
	interrupt client node bindings.

Example:

vl53l0x@29 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&vl53l0x_pins>;

	compatible = "st,vl53l0x-i2c";
	reg = <0x29>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio3>;
	interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
}
