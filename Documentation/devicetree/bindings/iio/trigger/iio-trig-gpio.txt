Industrial I/O - GPIO based trigger

GPIOs may be used as IIO trigger provider, when trigger is connected to
GPIO lines.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "iio-gpio-trigger"
- gpios: Should specify one GPIO line used as trigger source.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
- #io-trigger-cells: Should be 0, as simple trigger provider.
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- label: String to specifiy trigger name.
- gpio-trigger-rising-edge: A rising edge on GPIO will trigger.
- gpio-trigger-falling-edge: A falling edge on GPIO will trigger.
  Note: Both rising and falling edge may be used. In case none of
  rising or falling edge is selected, rising edge is selected by
  default.

Example:
	gpiotrig0: iio-gpio-trigger0 {
		#io-trigger-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "iio-gpio-trigger";
		gpios = <&gpioa 11 0>;
	}
