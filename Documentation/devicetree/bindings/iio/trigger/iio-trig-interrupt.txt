Interrupt based trigger

Any internal or external interrupt may be used as trigger source for
devices like sensors, ADCs... As an example, external signal can be
routed to a GPIO, and turned into an interrupt driven trigger.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "interrupt-trigger"
- interrupts: The interrupt used as trigger. Generic interrupt client node as
  described in ../../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional properties:
- #io-trigger-cells = <0>; See the IIO bindings, IIO trigger providers
  and consumers sections in ../iio-bindings.txt

Example:
	trig0: interrupt-trigger0 {
		#io-trigger-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "interrupt-trigger";
		interrupts = <11 0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpioa>;
	}
