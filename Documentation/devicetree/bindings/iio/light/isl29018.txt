* ISL 29018/29023/29035 I2C ALS, Proximity, and Infrared sensor

Required properties:

  - compatible: Should be one of
		"isil,isl29018"
		"isil,isl29023"
		"isil,isl29035"
  - reg: the I2C address of the device

Optional properties:

  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt client
  node bindings.

  - vdd-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides vdd power to the sensor.

  - vdda-supply: phandle to the regulator that provides vdda power to the sensor.

Example:

isl29018@44 {
	compatible = "isil,isl29018";
	reg = <0x44>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(Z, 2) IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
