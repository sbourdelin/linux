* Freescale FXAS21002C Digital Angular Rate Gyroscope

Required properties:

  - compatible: must be "fsl,fxas21002c"
  - reg : the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:

  - interrupt-parent	: phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
			  see interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - interrupts		: The first interrupt listed must be the one
			  connected to the INT1 pin, the second interrupt
			  listed must be the one connected to the INT2 pin.
			  The interrupts can be triggered on rising or falling
			  edges alike.
			  see interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
  - vdd-supply 		: The main voltage regulator
  - iovdd-supply 	: The IO voltage regulator
			  see regulator/regulator.txt
  - reset-gpios		: GPIO used to reset the device.
			  see gpio/gpio.txt.
  - mount-matrix	: see iio/mount-matrix.txt

Example:
gyroscope@20 {
	compatible = "fsl,fxas21002c";
	reg = <0x20>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio0 2 0>;
	vdd-supply = <&vref>;
	iovdd-supply = <&vref2>;
	interrupt-parent = <&foo>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <1 (IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING | IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING)>;
};
