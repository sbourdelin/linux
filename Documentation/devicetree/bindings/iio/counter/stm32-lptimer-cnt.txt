STMicroelectronics STM32 Low Power Timer quadrature encoder and counter

STM32 LP Timer provides several counter modes. It can be used as:
- quadrature encoder to detect angular position and direction of rotary
  elements, from IN1 and IN2 input signals.
- simple counter from IN1 input signal.

Must be a sub-node of an STM32 LP Timer device tree node.
See ../mfd/stm32-lptimer.txt for details about the parent node.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "st,stm32-lptimer-counter".
- A pinctrl state named "default" can be defined to set IN1/IN2 pins in mode
  of operation for LP Timer input signals on external pin.

Example:
	lptimer1: lptimer@0x40002400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer";
		...
		counter {
			compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer-counter";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&lptim1_in_pins>;
		};
	};
