* PNI RM3100 9-axis magnetometer sensor

I2C Bus:

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "pni,rm3100-i2c"
- reg : the I2C address of the magnetometer

Optional properties:

- interrupts: data ready (DRDY) from the chip.
  The interrupts can be triggered on rising edges.

	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
	interrupt client node bindings.

- pinctrl-*: pinctrl setup for DRDY line.

Example:

rm3100: rm3100@20 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&rm3100_pins>;

	compatible = "pni,rm3100-i2c";
	reg = <0x20>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};

SPI Bus:

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "pni,rm3100-spi"
- reg : address of sensor, usually 0 or 1.

Optional properties:

- interrupts: data ready (DRDY) from the chip.
  The interrupts can be triggered on rising edges.

	Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
	interrupt client node bindings.

- pinctrl-*: pinctrl setup for DRDY line, depands on archtechture.

Example:

rm3100: rm3100@0{
	compatible = "pni,rm3100-spi";
	reg = <0>;

	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
