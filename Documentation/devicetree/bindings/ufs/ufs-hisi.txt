* Hisilicon Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Host Controller

UFS nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS hardware macro.
Each UFS Host Controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible list, contains one of the following -
			"hisilicon,hi3660-ufs" for hisi ufs host controller
			 present on Hi3660 chipset.
- reg               : should contain UFS register address space & UFS SYS CTRL register address,
- interrupt-parent  : interrupt device
- interrupts        : interrupt number
- clocks	        : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs
- clock-names       : List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		      order as the clocks property. "clk_ref", "clk_phy" is optional

Optional properties for board device:
- reset-gpio			: specifies to reset devices

Example:

	ufs: ufs@ff3b0000 {
		compatible = "jedec,ufs-1.1", "hisilicon,hi3660-ufs";
		/* 0: HCI standard */
		/* 1: UFS SYS CTRL */
		reg = <0x0 0xff3b0000 0x0 0x1000>,
			<0x0 0xff3b1000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 278 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&crg_ctrl HI3660_CLK_GATE_UFSIO_REF>,
			<&crg_ctrl HI3660_CLK_GATE_UFSPHY_CFG>;
		clock-names = "clk_ref", "clk_phy";
		freq-table-hz = <0 0>, <0 0>;
		reset-gpio = <&gpio18 1 0>;
	}
