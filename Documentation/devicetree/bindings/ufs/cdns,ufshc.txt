* Cadence Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Controller

UFS nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible	: compatible list, contains the following controller:
			"cdns,ufshc"
		  complemented with the JEDEC version:
			"jedec,ufs-2.0"

- reg		: address and length of the UFS register set
- interrupts	: one interrupt mapping
- clocks	: List of phandle and clock specifier pairs.
- clock-names	: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		  order as the clocks property. "core" is mandatory.
- freq-table-hz	: Array of <min max> operating frequencies stored in the same
		  order as the clocks property. If this property is not
		  defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed
		  that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a
		  fixed rate clock source.

Example:
	ufs@fd030000 {
		compatible = "cdns,ufshc", "jedec,ufs-2.0";
		reg = <0xfd030000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		freq-table-hz = <0 0>, <0 0>;
		clocks = <&ufs_core_clk>, <&ufs_phy_clk>;
		clock-names = "core_clk", "phy_clk";
	};
