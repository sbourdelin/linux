* Spreadtrum serial UART

Required properties:
- compatible must contain:
  * "sprd,sc9836-uart" for SC9836 and all Spreadtrum SoCs
  This also can be specific with:
  * "sprd, sc9860-uart" for SC9860

- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: exactly one interrupt specifier
- clocks: phandles to input clocks.

Example:
	uart0: serial@70000000 {
		compatible = "sprd,sc9838-uart",
			     "sprd,sc9836-uart";
		reg = <0x000000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&ext_26m>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
