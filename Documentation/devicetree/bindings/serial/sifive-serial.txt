SiFive asynchronous serial interface (UART)

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "sifive,fu540-c000-uart0" or "sifive,uart0"
- reg: address and length of the register space
- interrupt-parent: should contain a phandle pointing to the SoC interrupt
    controller device node that the UART interrupts are connected to
- interrupts: Should contain the UART interrupt identifier
- clocks: Should contain a clock identifier for the UART's parent clock


Example:

uart0: serial@10010000 {
	compatible = "sifive,uart0";
	interrupt-parent = <&plic0>;
	interrupts = <80>;
	reg = <0x0 0x10010000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&prci PRCI_CLK_TLCLK>;
};
