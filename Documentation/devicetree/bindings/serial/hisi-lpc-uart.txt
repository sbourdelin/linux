* Hisilicon hip06 UART through low-pin-count

Required properties:
- compatible : "hisilicon,lpc-uart"
- reg : offset and length of the I/O port set for the device.
- indirect-io : identify this device based on the indirect IO mechanism.

Clock handling:
  The clock rate of this device is same as the 8250 default clock rate, that
  is 1843200. No need to define the clock rate in device tree.

Note:
  This device depends on its parent device whose compatible string is
  "hisilicon,low-pin-count".

  The format of "reg" property follows the I/O space definition in ISA/EISA
  binding specification linked to:
  http://www.firmware.org/1275/bindings/isa/isa0_4d.ps

Example:

	uart0: lpc-uart@2f8 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,lpc-uart";
		reg = <0x01 0x2f8 0x08>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Example with low-pin-count parent device:

	isa@a01b0000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,low-pin-count";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0xa01b0000 0x0 0x1000>;
		ranges = <0x01 0xe4 0x0 0xe4 0x04>,
			<0x01 0x2f8 0x0 0x2f8 0x08>;

		ipmi0: bt@e4 {
			compatible = "ipmi-bt";
			device_type = "ipmi";
			reg = <0x01 0xe4 0x04>;
			status = "disabled";
		};

		uart0: lpc-uart@2f8 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,lpc-uart";
			reg = <0x01 0x2f8 0x08>;
			status = "disabled";
		};
	};
