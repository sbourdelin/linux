* Broadcom cable/DSL/settop platforms

Required properties:

- compatible: "brcm,bcm3368", "brcm,bcm3384", "brcm,bcm33843"
              "brcm,bcm3384-viper", "brcm,bcm33843-viper"
              "brcm,bcm6328", "brcm,bcm6358", "brcm,bcm6362", "brcm,bcm6368",
              "brcm,bcm63168", "brcm,bcm63268",
              "brcm,bcm7125", "brcm,bcm7346", "brcm,bcm7358", "brcm,bcm7360",
              "brcm,bcm7362", "brcm,bcm7420", "brcm,bcm7425"

The experimental -viper variants are for running Linux on the 3384's
BMIPS4355 cable modem CPU instead of the BMIPS5000 application processor.

Power management
----------------

For power management (particularly, S2/S3/S5 system suspend), the following SoC
components are needed:

= Always-On control block (AON CTRL)

This hardware provides control registers for the "always-on" (even in low-power
modes) hardware, such as the Power Management State Machine (PMSM).

Required properties:
- compatible     : should contain "brcm,brcmstb-aon-ctrl"
- reg            : the register start and length for the AON CTRL block

Example:

aon-ctrl@410000 {
	compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-aon-ctrl";
	reg = <0x410000 0x400>;
};

= Memory controllers

A Broadcom STB SoC typically has a number of independent memory controllers,
each of which may have several associated hardware blocks, which are versioned
independently (control registers, DDR PHYs, etc.). One might consider
describing these controllers as a parent "memory controllers" block, which
contains N sub-nodes (one for each controller in the system), each of which is
associated with a number of hardware register resources (e.g., its PHY). See
the example device tree snippet below.

== MEMC (MEMory Controller)

Represents a single memory controller instance.

Required properties:
- compatible     : should contain "brcm,brcmstb-memc" and "simple-bus"

Should contain subnodes for any of the following relevant hardware resources:

== DDR PHY control

Control registers for this memory controller's DDR PHY.

Required properties:
- compatible     : should contain one of these
	"brcm,brcmstb-ddr-phy-v64.5"
	"brcm,brcmstb-ddr-phy"

- reg            : the DDR PHY register range

== MEMC Arbiter

The memory controller arbiter is responsible for memory clients allocation
(bandwidth, priorities etc.) and needs to have its contents restored during
deep sleep states (S3).

Required properties:

- compatible	: should contain one of these
	"brcm,brcmstb-memc-arb-v10.0.0.0"
	"brcm,brcmstb-memc-arb"

- reg		: the DDR Arbiter register range

== Timers

The Broadcom STB chips contain a timer block with several general purpose
timers that can be used.

Required properties:

- compatible	: should contain "brcm,brcmstb-timers"
- reg		: the timers register range
