* Freescale IMX8MQ IOMUX Controller

Please refer to fsl,imx-pinctrl.txt and pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory
for common binding part and usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: "fsl,imx8mq-iomuxc"
- fsl,pins: each entry consists of 6 integers and represents the mux and config
  setting for one pin.  The first 5 integers <mux_reg conf_reg input_reg mux_val
  input_val> are specified using a PIN_FUNC_ID macro, which can be found in
  imx8mq-pinfunc.h under device tree source folder.  The last integer CONFIG is
  the pad setting value like pull-up on this pin.  Please refer to i.MX8M Quad
  Reference Manual for detailed CONFIG settings.

Examples:

&uart1 {
       pinctrl-names = "default";
       pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_uart1>;
};

&iomuxc {
	pinctrl_uart1: uart1grp {
		fsl,pins = <
			MX8MQ_IOMUXC_UART1_RXD_UART1_DCE_RX 0x49
			MX8MQ_IOMUXC_UART1_TXD_UART1_DCE_TX 0x49
		>;
	};
};
