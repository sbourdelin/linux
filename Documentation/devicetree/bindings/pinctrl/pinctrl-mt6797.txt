* Mediatek MT6797 Pin Controller

The Mediatek's MT6797 Pin controller is used to control SoC pins.

Required properties:
- compatible: Value should be one of the following.
              "mediatek,mt6797-pinctrl", compatible with mt6797 pinctrl.
- reg:        Should contain address and size for gpio, iocfgl, iocfgb,
              iocfgr and iocfgt register bases.
- reg-names:  An array of strings describing the "reg" entries. Must
              contain "gpio", "iocfgl", "iocfgb", "iocfgr", "iocfgt".
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the gpio pin number
               and the second cell is used for optional parameters.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be two.
- interrupts : The interrupt outputs from the controller.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

Subnode format
A pinctrl node should contain at least one subnodes representing the
pinctrl groups available on the machine. Each subnode will list the
pins it needs, and how they should be configured, with regard to muxer
configuration, pullups, drive strength, input enable/disable and input schmitt.

    node {
        pinmux = <PIN_NUMBER_PINMUX>;
        GENERIC_PINCONFIG;
    };

Required properties:
- pinmux: Integer array, represents gpio pin number and mux setting.
          Supported pin number and mux varies for different SoCs, and are
          defined as macros in dt-bindings/pinctrl/<soc>-pinfunc.h directly.

Optional properties:
- GENERIC_PINCONFIG: is the generic pinconfig options to use, bias-disable,
    bias-pull-down, bias-pull-up, input-enable, input-disable, output-low, output-high,
    input-schmitt-enable, input-schmitt-disable and drive-strength are valid.

    Some special pins have extra pull up strength, there are R0 and R1 pull-up
    resistors available, but for user, it's only need to set R1R0 as 00, 01, 10 or 11.
    So when config bias-pull-up, it support arguments for those special pins.
    Some macros have been defined for this usage, such as MTK_PUPD_SET_R1R0_00.
    See dt-bindings/pinctrl/mt65xx.h.

    When config drive-strength, it can support some arguments, such as
    MTK_DRIVE_4mA, MTK_DRIVE_6mA, etc. See dt-bindings/pinctrl/mt65xx.h.

Examples:

        pio: pinctrl@10005000 {
                compatible = "mediatek,mt6797-pinctrl";
                reg = <0 0x10005000 0 0x1000>,
                      <0 0x10002000 0 0x400>,
                      <0 0x10002400 0 0x400>,
                      <0 0x10002800 0 0x400>,
                      <0 0x10002C00 0 0x400>;
                reg-names = "gpio", "iocfgl", "iocfgb",
                            "iocfgr", "iocfgt";
                gpio-controller;
                #gpio-cells = <2>;

                uart1_pins_a: uart1 {
                        pins1 {
                                pinmux = <MT6797_GPIO232__FUNC_URXD1>,
                                         <MT6797_GPIO233__FUNC_UTXD1>;
                        };
                };
        };
