* Spreadtrum Pin Controller

The Spreadtrum pin controller are organized in 3 blocks (types).

The first block comprises some global control registers, and each
register contains several feilds with one bit or several bits to
configurate for some global common configuration, such as domain
pad driving level, system control select and so on. We recognise
every feild comprising one bit or several bits in one global control
register as one pin, thus we should record every pin's bit offset,
bit width and register offset to configurate this feild (pin).

The second block comprises some common registers which have unified
register definition, and each register described one pin is used
to configurate pin sleep mode and function select.

The last block comprises some misc registers which also have unified
register definition, and each register described one pin is used to
configurate drive strength, pull up/down and so on.

This driver supports the generic pin multiplexing and configuration
bindings. For details on each properties, you can refer to
./pinctrl-bindings.txt.

Required properties for Spreadtrum pin controller:
- compatible: "sprd,<soc>-pinctrl"
  Please refer to each sprd,<soc>-pinctrl.txt binding doc for supported SoCs.

Required properties for pin configuration node:
- sprd,pins: each entry consists of 2 integers and represents the pin
  id and config setting for one pin.
