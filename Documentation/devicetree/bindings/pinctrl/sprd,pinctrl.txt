* Spreadtrum Pin Controller

The Spreadtrum pin controller are organized in 3 blocks (types).

The first block comprises some global control registers, and each
register contains several bit fields with one bit or several bits
to configure for some global common configuration, such as domain
pad driving level, system control select and so on. We recognise
every fields comprising one bit or several bits in one global control
register as one pin, thus we should record every pin's bit offset,
bit width and register offset to configure this field (pin). Since
this type pins' configuration are very tricky and different for each
register, we introduce "sprd,ctrl" property to set the various global
control configuration.

The second block comprises some common registers which have unified
register definition, and each register described one pin is used
to configure the pin sleep mode and function select. Now we have 4
systems on SC9860 SoC: AP system, PUBCP system, TGLDSP system and
AGDSP system. In some situation we have some pin-sleep related
configuration need to set when one of system goes into deep sleep
mode. For example, if we set the pin sleep mode as AP_SLEEP, which
means when AP system goes into deep sleep mode, this pin's sleep
related properties (input/output or pullup/down) will be set
automatically. Thus we intoduce "sprd,sleep_mode" to set pin sleep
mode.

The last block comprises some misc registers which also have unified
register definition, and each register described one pin is used to
configure drive strength, pull up/down and so on. Especially for pull
up, we introduce "sprd,pullup" property for two kind configuration:
PULLUP_20K or PULLUP_4_7K, which means the pullup resistor is 20K or
4.7K.
