Ingenic jz47xx pin controller

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

For the jz47xx SoCs, pin control is tightly bound with GPIO ports. All pins may
be used as GPIOs, multiplexed device functions are configured within the
GPIO port configuration registers and it is typical to refer to pins using the
naming scheme "PxN" where x is a character identifying the GPIO port with
which the pin is associated and N is an integer from 0 to 31 identifying the
pin within that GPIO port. For example PA0 is the first pin in GPIO port A, and
PB31 is the last pin in GPIO port B. The jz4740 contains 4 GPIO ports, PA to
PD, for a total of 128 pins. The jz4780 contains 6 GPIO ports, PA to PF, for a
total of 192 pins.


##### Pin controller node #####

Required properties:
- compatible: One of:
  - "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl"
  - "ingenic,jz4780-pinctrl"
- #address-cells: Should contain the integer 1.
- #size-cells: Should contain the integer 1.
- ranges: Should be empty.

Required sub-nodes:
  - gpio-chips (see below)
  - functions (see below)

The pin controller node must have two sub-nodes, 'gpio-chips' and 'functions'.


##### 'gpio-chips' sub-node #####

The gpio-chips node will contain sub-nodes that correspond to GPIO controllers
(one sub-node per GPIO controller).

Required properties:
- #address-cells: Should contain the integer 1.
- #size-cells: Should contain the integer 1.
- ranges: Should be empty.


##### 'functions' sub-node #####

The "functions" node will contain sub-nodes that correspond to pin function
nodes.

Required properties:
- None.


##### GPIO controller node #####

Each subnode of the 'gpio-chips' node is a GPIO controller node.

Required properties:
- gpio-controller: Identifies this node as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells: Should contain the integer 2.
- reg: Should contain the physical address and length of the GPIO controller's
  configuration registers.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-controller: The GPIO controllers can optionally configure the
  GPIOs as interrupt sources. In this case, the 'interrupt-controller'
  standalone property should be supplied.
- #interrupt-cells: Required if 'interrupt-controller' is also specified.
  In that case, it should contain the integer 2.
- interrupts: Required if 'interrupt-controller' is also specified.
  In that case, it should contain the IRQ number of this GPIO controller.
- ingenic,pull-ups: A bit mask identifying the pins associated with this GPIO
  port which feature a pull-up resistor. The default mask is 0x0.
- ingenic,pull-downs: A bit mask identifying the pins associated with this GPIO
  port which feature a pull-down resistor. The default mask is 0x0.
  Each pin of the jz47xx SoCs may feature a single bias resistor, thus there
  should be no bits which are set in both ingenic,pull-ups & ingenic,pull-downs.


##### Pin function node #####

Each subnode of the 'functions' node is a pin function node.

These subnodes represent a functionality of the SoC which may be exposed
through one or more groups of pins, represented as subnodes of the pin
function node. For example a function may be uart0, which may be exposed
through the group of pins PF0 to PF3.

Required pin function node properties:
- None.


##### Pin group node #####

Each subnode of a pin function node is a pin group node.

Required pin group node properties:
- ingenic,pins: A set of values representing the pins within this pin group and
  their configuration. Four values should be provided for each pin:
  - The phandle of the GPIO controller node for the GPIO port within which the
    pin is found.
  - The index of the pin within its GPIO port (an integer in the range 0 to 31
    inclusive).
  - The index of the shared function port to be programmed in the GPIO port
    registers for this pin.
    Tables of these may be found in the jz4740 and jz4780 programming
    manuals within the "General-Purpose I/O Ports" -> "Overview" section.
    The value can either be supplied directly (0 for function 0, 1 for
    function 1, etc.) or using the macros present in
    <dt-bindings/pinctrl/ingenic.h>.
    The special macro JZ_PIN_MODE_GPIO can be used to specify that the pin is
    to be used as a GPIO. This is useful, for instance, when you just want to
    set the electrical configuration of a pin used as GPIO.
  - The phandle of a pin configuration node specifying the electrical
    configuration that should be applied to the pin.

For example the function 'msc0' may be exposed through 2 different pin groups,
one in GPIO port A and one in GPIO port E:

  bias-configs {
    nobias: nobias {
      bias-disable;
    };
  };

  functions {
    pinfunc_msc0: msc0 {
      pins_msc0_pa: msc0-pa {
        ingenic,pins = <&gpa  4 1 &nobias   /* d4 */
                        &gpa  5 1 &nobias   /* d5 */
                        &gpa  6 1 &nobias   /* d6 */
                        &gpa  7 1 &nobias   /* d7 */
                        &gpa 18 1 &nobias   /* clk */
                        &gpa 19 1 &nobias   /* cmd */
                        &gpa 20 1 &nobias   /* d0 */
                        &gpa 21 1 &nobias   /* d1 */
                        &gpa 22 1 &nobias   /* d2 */
                        &gpa 23 1 &nobias   /* d3 */
                        &gpa 24 1 &nobias>; /* rst */
      };

      pins_msc0_pe: msc0-pe {
        ingenic,pins = <&gpe 20 0 &nobias   /* d0 */
                        &gpe 21 0 &nobias   /* d1 */
                        &gpe 22 0 &nobias   /* d2 */
                        &gpe 23 0 &nobias   /* d3 */
                        &gpe 28 0 &nobias   /* clk */
                        &gpe 29 0 &nobias>; /* cmd */
      };
    };
  };


##### Pin configuration node #####

The pin configuration nodes are referenced by phandle, and can be placed
anywhere in the device tree (including in the pin controller node, or in a
sub-node that is not 'gpio-chips' or 'functions').

Pin configuration nodes use generic pinconf properties to specify an electrical
configuration of a pin. The only configurable property for a pin of the jz47xx
SoCs is whether to enable its bias resistor. Thus the only supported pinconf
properties are:

- bias-disable
- bias-pull-up
- bias-pull-down

No arguments are supported for any of these properties.
