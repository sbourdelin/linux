RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI)

The RISC-V privileged ISA specification mandates the presence of a supervisor
binary interface that performs some operations which might otherwise require
particularly complicated instructions.  This interface includes
inter-processor interrupts, TLB flushes, i-cache and TLB shootdowns, a
console, and power management.

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain one of the following
 * "riscv,sbi" for the SBI defined by the privileged specification of the
   system.

Example:

firmware {
	sbi {
		compatible = "riscv,sbi";
	};
};
