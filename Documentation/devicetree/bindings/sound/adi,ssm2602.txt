Analog Devices SSM2602, SSM2603 and SSM2604 I2S audio CODEC devices

SSM2602 support both I2C and SPI as the configuration interface,
the selection is made by the MODE strap-in pin.
SSM2603 and SSM2604 only support I2C as the configuration interface.

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of "adi,ssm2602", "adi,ssm2603" or "adi,ssm2604"

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C, the chip select
          number for SPI.

Optional properties:

  - startup-delay-us : delay between powering on and activating the digital
                       core, determined by the decoupling capacitor C on the
		       VMID pin: delay [µs] = C [µF] * 25000 / 3.5

 Example:

	ssm2602: ssm2602@1a {
		compatible = "adi,ssm2602";
		reg = <0x1a>;
		startup-delay-us = <34000>; /* 4.7 µF * 25000 / 3.5 -> ~34 ms */
	};
