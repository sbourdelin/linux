Simple-Graph-SCU-Card:

Simple-Graph-SCU-Card specifies audio DAI connections of SoC <-> codec.
It is based on common bindings for device graphs.
see ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

Basically, Simple-Graph-SCU-Card property is same as Simple-Card / Simple-Graph-Card.
see ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.txt
    ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-graph-card.txt

Main difference between Simple-Graph-Card and Simple-Graph-SCU-Card is that
Simple-Graph-SCU-Card can use multi CPU.

Required properties:

- compatible				: "asoc-simple-graph-scu-card";
- type					: "sound";
- simple-audio-card,routing		: see simple-card.txt

Example

ak4643: codec@12 {
	compatible = "asahi-kasei,ak4643";
	...
	port {
		type = "sound";
		ak4643_fe: endpoint@0 {
			remote-endpoint = <&rsnd_fe>;
			...
		};
		ak4643_be: endpoint@1 {
			remote-endpoint = <&rsnd_be>;
			...
		};
	};
};

rcar_sound {
	...
	ports {
		compatible = "asoc-simple-graph-scu-card";

		simple-audio-card,name = "graph-sound";
		simple-audio-card,format = "left_j";
		simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&rsnd_fe>;
		simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&rsnd_fe>;
		simple-audio-card,convert-rate = <48000>;
		simple-audio-card,convert-channels = <2>;
		simple-audio-card,prefix = "ak4642";
		simple-audio-card,routing =
				"ak4642 Playback", "DAI0 Playback",
				"ak4642 Playback", "DAI1 Playback";

		port@0 {
			type = "sound";
			rsnd_fe: endpoint@0 {
				remote-endpoint = <&ak4643_fe>;
				...
			};
		};
		port@1 {
			type = "sound";
			rsnd_be: endpoint@1 {
				remote-endpoint = <&ak4643_be>;
				...
			};
		};
	};
};
