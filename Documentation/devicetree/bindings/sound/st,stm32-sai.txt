STMicroelectronics STM32 Serial Audio Interface (SAI).

The SAI interface (Serial Audio Interface) offers a wide set of audio protocols
as I2S standards, LSB or MSB-justified, PCM/DSP, TDM, and AC'97.
The SAI contains two independent audio sub-blocks. Each sub-block has
its own clock generator and I/O lines controller.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "st,stm32f4-sai"
  - reg: Base address and size of SAI common register set.
  - clocks: Must contain phandle and clock specifier pairs for each entry
	in clock-names.
  - clock-names: Must contain "clk_x8k" and "clk_x11k"
	"clk_x8k": SAI parent clock for sampling rates multiple of 8kHz.
	"clk_x11k": SAI parent clock for sampling rates multiple of 11.025kHz.
  - interrupts: cpu DAI interrupt line shared by SAI sub-blocks

Note: Each SAI controller should have an alias correctly numbered
in "aliases" node, to provide explicit name to CPU DAI.

Optional properties:
  - resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the SAI

SAI subnodes:
Two subnodes corresponding to SAI sub-block instances A et B can be defined.
Subnode can be omitted for unsused sub-block.

SAI subnodes required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "st,stm32-sai-sub-a" or "st,stm32-sai-sub-b"
	for SAI sub-block A or B respectively.
  - reg: Base address and size of SAI sub-block register set.
  - clocks: Must contain one phandle and clock specifier pair
	for sai_ck which feeds the internal clock generator.
  - clock-names: Must contain "sai_ck".
  - dmas: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/stm32-dma.txt
  - dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line
	"tx": if sai sub-block is configured as playback DAI
	"rx": if sai sub-block is configured as capture DAI
  - pinctrl-names: should contain only value "default"
  - pinctrl-0: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-stm32.txt
