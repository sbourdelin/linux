Texas Instruments TAS5720 Mono Audio amplifier

The TAS5720 serial control bus communicates through the I2C protocol only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "ti,tas5720"
- reg : I2C slave address

Optional properties:

- dvdd-supply : phandle to a 3.3-V supply for the digital circuitry
- pvdd-supply : phandle to a supply used for the Class-D amp and the analog
- interrupts  : reference to a GPIO pin connected to the TAS5720 FAULTZ pin for
                error reporting purposes

Note that in case of codec errors the driver relies on the TAS5720 datasheet-
proposed "Auto Recovery Circuit" (connection between the FAULTZ and SDZ device
pins) for continued operation. This connection should always be made independent
of whether the optional interrupt-based fault-reporting feature is used.

Example:

tas5720: tas5720@6c {
	status = "okay";
	compatible = "ti,tas5720";
	reg = <0x6c>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&tas572x_int_pin>;
	interrupts-extended = <&gpio1 28 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
};
