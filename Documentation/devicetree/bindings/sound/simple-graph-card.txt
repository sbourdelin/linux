Simple-Graph-Card:

Simple-Graph-Card specifies audio DAI connections of SoC <-> codec.
It is based on common bindings for device graphs.
see ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

Basically, Simple-Graph-Card property is same as Simple-Card.
see ${LINUX}/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.txt

Below are same as Simple-Card.

- clocks / system-clock-frequency

In Simple-Graph-Card, above properties need in CPU side port on DT.
And it needs to have "compatible" property too.
In addition, CPU side driver needs to call asoc_simple_card_try_to_probe_graph_card().
It will probe specified Card driver if it could find "compatible" property on port.
Otherwise, it will do nothing.

Required properties:

- compatible				: "asoc-simple-graph-card";
- type					: "sound";

Example

ak4643: codec@12 {
	compatible = "asahi-kasei,ak4643";
	...
	port {
		type = "sound";
		ak4643_port: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&rcar_ak4643_port>;
			...
		};
	};
};

rcar_sound {
	...
	port {
		compatible = "asoc-simple-graph-card";

		simple-audio-card,format = "left_j";
		simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&ak4643_port>;
		simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&ak4643_port>;
		type = "sound";
		rcar_ak4643_port: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&ak4643_port>;
			...
		};
	};
};
