RT5663 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C only.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5663".

- reg : The I2C address of the device.

- interrupts : The CODEC's interrupt output.

Optional properties:

- "realtek,dc_offset_l_manual"
- "realtek,dc_offset_r_manual"
- "realtek,dc_offset_l_manual_mic"
- "realtek,dc_offset_r_manual_mic"
  Based on the different PCB layout, add the manual offset value to
  compensate the DC offset for each L and R channel, and they are different
  between headphone and headset.
- "realtek,impedance_sensing_num"
  The matrix row number of the impedance sensing table.
- "realtek,impedance_sensing_table"
  The matrix rows of the impedance sensing table are consisted by impedance
  minimum, impedance maximun, volume, DC offset w/o and w/ mic of each L and
  R channel accordingly.
