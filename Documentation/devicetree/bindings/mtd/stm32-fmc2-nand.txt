- st,fmc2_timings: array of 8 bytes for NAND timings. The meanings of
  these bytes are:
  byte 0 TCLR      : CLE to RE delay in number of AHB clock cycles, only 4 bits
                     are valid. Zero means one clock cycle, 15 means 16 clock
                     cycles.
  byte 1 TAR       : ALE to RE delay, 4 bits are valid. Same format as TCLR.
  byte 2 THIZ      : number of HCLK clock cycles during which the data bus is
                     kept in Hi-Z (tristate) after the start of a write access.
                     Only valid for write transactions. Zero means 1 cycle,
                     255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 3 TWAIT     : number of HCLK clock cycles to assert the command to the
                     NAND flash in response to SMWAITn. Zero means 1 cycle,
                     255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 4 THOLD_MEM : common memory space timing
                     number of HCLK clock cycles to hold the address (and data
                     when writing) after the command deassertion. Zero means
                     1 cycle, 255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 5 TSET_MEM  : common memory space timing
                     number of HCLK clock cycles to assert the address before
                     the command is asserted. Zero means 1 cycle, 255 means 256
                     cycles.
  byte 6 THOLD_ATT : attribute memory space timing
                     number of HCLK clock cycles to hold the address (and data
                     when writing) after the command deassertion. Zero means
                     1 cycle, 255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 7 TSET_ATT  : attribute memory space timing
                     number of HCLK clock cycles to assert the address before
                     the command is asserted. Zero means 1 cycle, 255 means 256
                     cycles.

The following ECC strength and step size are currently supported:
 - nand-ecc-strength = <1>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512> (HAMMING)
 - nand-ecc-strength = <4>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512> (BCH4)
 - nand-ecc-strength = <8>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512> (BCH8) (default)

Example:

	fmc2_nand: fmc2_nand@58002000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp15-fmc2";
		reg = <0x58002000 0x1000>,
		      <0x80000000 0x1000>,
		      <0x88010000 0x1000>,
		      <0x88020000 0x1000>,
		      <0x81000000 0x1000>,
		      <0x89010000 0x1000>,
		      <0x89020000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&rcc FMC_K>;
		resets = <&rcc FMC_R>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&fmc2_pins_a>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			nand-on-flash-bbt;
			st,fmc2_timings = /bits/ 8 <2 2 1 7 1 0 104 25>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
