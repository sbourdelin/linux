Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of:
  - "nvidia,tegra20-nand"
- reg: MMIO address range
- interrupts: interrupt output of the NFC controller
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - nand
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - nand

Optional properties:
- nvidia,wp-gpios: GPIO used to disable write protection of the flash

  Example:
	nand@70008000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-nand";
		reg = <0x70008000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_NDFLASH>;
		clock-names = "nand";
		resets = <&tegra_car 13>;
		reset-names = "nand";
	};
