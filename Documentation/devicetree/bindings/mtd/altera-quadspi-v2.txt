* Altera Quad SPI Controller Version 2

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "altr,quadspi-v2".
- reg : Contains at least two entries, and possibly three entries, each of
	which is a tuple consisting of a physical address and length.
- reg-names : Should contain the names "avl_csr" and "avl_mem" corresponding
	      to the control and status registers and qspi memory, respectively.


The Altera Quad SPI Controller Version 2 can be paired with a windowed bridge
in order to reduce the footprint of the memory interface.  When a windowed
bridge is used, reads and writes of data must be 32 bits wide.

Optional properties:
- reg-names : Should contain the name "avl_window", if the windowed bridge
	      is used.  This name corresponds to the register space that
	      controls the window.
- window-size : The size of the window which must be an even power of 2.
- read-bit-reverse : A boolean indicating the data read from the flash should
		     be bit reversed on a byte by byte basis before being
		     delivered to the MTD layer.
- write-bit-reverse : A boolean indicating the data written to the flash should
		      be bit reversed on a byte by byte basis.

Example:

qspi: spi@a0001000 {
	compatible = "altr,quadspi-v2";
	reg = <0xa0001000 0x40>, <0xb0000000 0x4000000>;
	reg-names = "avl_csr", "avl_mem";

	flash@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		label = "FPGA Image";
	};
};
