* Adaptrum Anarion Quad SPI controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "adaptrum,anarion-qspi".
- reg : Contains two entries, each of which is a tuple consisting of a
	physical address and length. The first entry is the address and
	length of the controller register set. The second entry is the
	address and length of the memory-mapped flash. This second region is
	the region where the controller responds to XIP requests, and may be
	larger than the size of the attached flash.

Example:

	qspi: qspi@f200f000 {
		compatible = "adaptrum,anarion-qspi";
		reg = 	<0xf200f000 0x1000>,
			<0x20000000 0x08000000>;

		flash0: w25q128fvn@0 {
			...
		}
	};
