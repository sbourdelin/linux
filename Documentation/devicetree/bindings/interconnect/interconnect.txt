Interconnect Provider Device Tree Bindings
=========================================

The purpose of this document is to define a common set of generic interconnect
providers/consumers properties.


= interconnect providers =

The interconnect provider binding is intended to represent the interconnect
controllers in the system. Each provider registers a set of interconnect
nodes, which expose the interconnect related capabilities of the interconnect
to consumer drivers. These capabilities can be throughput, latency, priority
etc. The consumer drivers set constraints on interconnect path (or endpoints)
depending on the usecase.

Required properties:
- compatible : contains the interconnect provider vendor specific compatible
	       string
- reg : register space of the interconnect controller hardware
- #interconnect-cells : number of cells in a interconnect specifier needed to
		       encode the interconnect node id.


Optional properties:
interconnect-port : A phandle and interconnect provider specifier as defined by
		bindings of the interconnect provider specified by phandle.
		This denotes the port to which the interconnect consumer is
		wired. It is used when there are multiple interconnect providers
		that have one or multiple links between them.

Example:

		snoc: snoc@0580000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-snoc";
			reg = <0x580000 0x14000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_SNOC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_SNOC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
			interconnect-port = <&bimc MAS_SNOC_CFG>,
					<&bimc SNOC_BIMC_0_MAS>,
					<&bimc SNOC_BIMC_1_MAS>,
					<&pnoc SNOC_PNOC_SLV>;
		};
		bimc: bimc@0400000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-bimc";
			reg = <0x400000 0x62000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_BIMC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_BIMC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
			interconnect-port = <&snoc BIMC_SNOC_MAS>;
		};
		pnoc: pnoc@500000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-pnoc";
			reg = <0x500000 0x11000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_PCNOC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_PCNOC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
			interconnect-port = <&snoc PNOC_SNOC_SLV>;
		};

= interconnect consumers =

The interconnect consumers are device nodes which consume the interconnect
path(s) provided by the interconnect provider. There can be multiple
interconnect providers on a SoC and the consumer may consume multiple paths
from different providers depending on usecase and the components it has to
interact with.

Required-properties:
interconnect-port : A phandle and interconnect provider specifier as defined by
		bindings of the interconnect provider specified by phandle.
		This denotes the port to which the interconnect consumer is
		wired.
interconnect-path : List of phandles to the data path endpoints.
interconnect-path-names : List of interconnect path name strings sorted in the
		same order as the interconnect-path property.  Consumers drivers
		will use interconnect-path-names to match the link names with
		interconnect specifiers.

Example:

	sdhci@07864000 {
		...
		interconnect-port = <&pnoc MAS_PNOC_SDCC_2>;
		interconnect-path = <&blsp1_uart2>;
		interconnect-path-names = "spi";
	};
