Interconnect Provider Device Tree Bindings
=========================================

The purpose of this document is to define a common set of generic interconnect
providers/consumers properties.


= interconnect providers =

The interconnect provider binding is intended to represent the interconnect
controllers in the system. Each provider registers a set of interconnect
nodes, which expose the interconnect related capabilities of the interconnect
to consumer drivers. These capabilities can be throughput, latency, priority
etc. The consumer drivers set constraints on interconnect path (or endpoints)
depending on the usecase. Interconnect providers can also be interconnect
consumers, such as in the case where two network-on-chip fabrics interface
directly

Required properties:
- compatible : contains the interconnect provider vendor specific compatible
	       string
- reg : register space of the interconnect controller hardware
- #interconnect-cells : number of cells in a interconnect specifier needed to
		       encode the interconnect node id.

Example:

		snoc: snoc@0580000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-snoc";
			reg = <0x580000 0x14000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_SNOC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_SNOC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
		};
		bimc: bimc@0400000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-bimc";
			reg = <0x400000 0x62000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_BIMC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_BIMC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
		};
		pnoc: pnoc@500000 {
			compatible = "qcom,msm-bus-pnoc";
			reg = <0x500000 0x11000>;
			#interconnect-cells = <1>;
			clock-names = "bus_clk", "bus_a_clk";
			clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_PCNOC_CLK>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_PCNOC_A_CLK>;
			status = "okay";
		};

= interconnect consumers =

The interconnect consumers are device nodes which consume the interconnect
path(s) provided by the interconnect provider. There can be multiple
interconnect providers on a SoC and the consumer may consume multiple paths
from different providers depending on usecase and the components it has to
interact with.

Required-properties:
interconnect-src : A phandle and interconnect provider specifier as defined by
		bindings of the interconnect provider specified by phandle.
		This denotes the source device port which will be used, as the
		device may have multiple master ports.
interconnect-dst : A phandle and internet provider specifier pointing to the
		local port of the target device.

Example:

	sdhci@07864000 {
		...
		interconnect-src = <&pnoc MAS_PNOC_SDCC_2>;
		interconnect-dst = <&pnoc SLV_BLSP_1>;
	};
