The aliases node
----------------

The aliases node contains properties that represent aliases to device tree
nodes. The name of the property is the alias name, the value is the path of
a the device tree node that corresponds to the alias. The path may be
specified as a string or a phandle.

Alias names are often suffixed with a numeric ID, especially when there may
be multiple instances of the same type. The ID typically corresponds to the
hardware layout, it may also be used by drivers for a stable mapping of
device names and hardware entities.

Alias names
-----------

The devicetree specification doesn't require the use of specific alias
names to refer to hardware entities of a given type, however the Linux
kernel aims for a certain level of consistency.

The following standardized alias names shall be used for their
corresponding hardware components:

  bluetoothN		Bluetooth controller
  ethernetN		Ethernet interface
  gpioN			GPIO controller
  i2cN			i2c bus
  mmcN			MMC bus
  rtcN			Real time clock
  serialN		UART port
  spiN			SPI bus
  wifiN			Wireless network interface

The above list is not exhaustive and will be extended over time. Please
send patches to devicetree@vger.kernel.org if you think a hardware
component and its alias name should be on the list.

Example
-------

aliases {
	bluetooth0 = "/soc/serial@fdf01000/bluetooth";
	rtc0 = &rtc0;
	wifi0 = &wlcore;
};
