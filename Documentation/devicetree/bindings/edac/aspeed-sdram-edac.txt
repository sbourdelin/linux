Aspeed AST2500 SoC EDAC device driver

The Aspeed AST2500 SoC supports DDR3 and DDR4 memory with and without ECC (error
correction check).

The memory controller supports SECDED (single bit error correction, double bit
error detection) and single bit error auto scrubbing by reserving 8 bits for
every 64 bit word (effectively reducing available memory to 8/9).

First, ECC must be configured in u-boot. Then, this driver will expose error
counters via the edac kernel framework.

A note on memory organization in ECC mode: every 512 bytes are followed by 64
bytes of ECC codes. The address remapping is done in hardware and is fully
transparent to firmware and software. Because of this, ECC mode must be
configured in u-boot as part of the memory initialization as one can not switch
from one mode to another when executing in memory.



Required properties:
- compatible: should be "aspeed,ast2500-sdram-edac"
- reg:        sdram controller register set should be <0x1e6e0000 0x174>
- interrupts: should be AVIC interrupt #0


Example:

	edac: sdram@1e6e0000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-sdram-edac";
		reg = <0x1e6e0000 0x174>;
		interrupts = <0>;
		status = "okay";
	};
