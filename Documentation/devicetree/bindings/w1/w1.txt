Generic devicetree bindings for onewire (w1) busses
===================================================

Onewire busses are described through nodes of their master bus controller.
Slave devices are listed as sub-nodes of such master devices. For now, one
one slave is allowed per bus master.


Example:

	onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		battery {
			compatible = "maxim,ds2760";
		};
	};
