Generic devicetree bindings for onewire (w1) busses
===================================================

Onewire busses are described through nodes of their master bus controller.
Slave devices are listed as sub-nodes of such master devices.

Example:

	onewire {
		compatible = "w1-gpio";
		gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		w1_slave: slave@0 {
			compatible = "maxim,w1-ds2760";
		};
	};
