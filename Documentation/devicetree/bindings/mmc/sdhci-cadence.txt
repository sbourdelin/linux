* Cadence SD/SDIO/eMMC Host Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following:
    "cdns,sd4hc"               - default of the IP
    "socionext,uniphier-sd4hc" - for Socionext UniPhier SoCs
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: a single interrupt specifier.
- clocks: phandle to the input clock.

Optional properties:
For eMMC configuration, supported speed modes are not indicated by the SDHCI
Capabilities Register.  Instead, the following properties should be specified
if supported.  See mmc.txt for details.
- mmc-ddr-1_8v
