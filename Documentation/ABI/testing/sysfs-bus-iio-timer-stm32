Description:
		Reading returns the list possible master modes which are:
		- "reset"     :	The UG bit from the TIMx_EGR register is used as trigger output (TRGO).
		- "enable"    : The Counter Enable signal CNT_EN is used as trigger output.
		- "update"    : The update event is selected as trigger output.
				For instance a master timer can then be used as a prescaler for a slave timer.
		- "compare_pulse" : The trigger output send a positive pulse when the CC1IF flag is to be set.
		- "OC1REF"    : OC1REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC2REF"    : OC2REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC3REF"    : OC3REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC4REF"    : OC4REF signal is used as trigger output.

KernelVersion:	4.12

Description:
		Reading returns the list possible slave modes which are:
		- "disabled"  : Parent trigger levels or edges have do not impact on trigger.
				Trigger is clocked by the internal clock.
				This is the default mode.
		- "encoder_1" : Trigger internal counter counts up/down on channel 2 edge depending on channel 1 level.
		- "encoder_2" : Trigger internal counter counts up/down on channel 1 edge depending on channel 2 level.
		- "encoder_3" : Trigger internal counter counts up/down on channels 1 & 2 edge
				depending on channel 1 & 2 level.
		- "reset"     : Rising edge on parent trigger reinitializes the trigger	and generates
				an update of auto-reload, prescaler and	repetition counter registers.
		- "gated"     : The trigger is enabled when the parent trigger input is high.
				The trigger stops (but is not reset) as soon as the parent trigger becomes low.
		- "trigger"   : The trigger starts at a rising edge of the parent trigger (but it is not reset).
		- "external_clock": Rising edges of the parent trigger clock the trigger.

		Encoder modes are used to automatically handle the counting direction of the internal counter.
		Those modes are typically used for high-accuracy rotor position sensing in electrical motors
		or for digital potentiometers. From the two outputs of a quadrature encoder sensor the timer
		extracts a clock on each and every active edge and adjusts the counting direction depending on
		the relative phase-shift between the two incomings signals. The timer counter thus directly
		holds the angular position of the motor or the potentionmeter.

		For "reset", "gated" and "trigger" modes the trigger will fire N+1 times when internal counter
		will reach the value of auto-reload register. N is defined by the value of repetition counter.
		Those modes could allow parent trigger to control when sampling frequency of the current trigger
		start or stop.
		Since PWM and trigger features are mixed in the same hardware block those 3 modes could be used
		to synchronize PWMs start while PWM sysfs API is used to set period and duty cycle.

		In "external clock" mode parent trigger can control the current trigger clock (and so the sampling
		frequency) for example to correct jittering.
