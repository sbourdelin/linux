KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Reading returns the list possible master modes which are:
		- "reset"     :	The UG bit from the TIMx_EGR register is used as trigger output (TRGO).
		- "enable"    : The Counter Enable signal CNT_EN is used as trigger output.
		- "update"    : The update event is selected as trigger output.
				For instance a master timer can then be used as a prescaler for a slave timer.
		- "compare_pulse" : The trigger output send a positive pulse when the CC1IF flag is to be set.
		- "OC1REF"    : OC1REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC2REF"    : OC2REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC3REF"    : OC3REF signal is used as trigger output.
		- "OC4REF"    : OC4REF signal is used as trigger output.

KernelVersion:	4.12
Contact:	benjamin.gaignard@st.com
Description:
		Reading returns the list possible slave modes which are:
		- "disabled"  : The prescaler is clocked directly by the internal clock.
		- "encoder_1" : Counter counts up/down on TI2FP1 edge depending on TI1FP2 level.
		- "encoder_2" : Counter counts up/down on TI1FP2 edge depending on TI2FP1 level.
		- "encoder_3" : Counter counts up/down on both TI1FP1 and TI2FP2 edges depending
				on the level of the other input.
		- "reset"     : Rising edge of the selected trigger input reinitializes the counter
				and generates an update of the registers.
		- "gated"     : The counter clock is enabled when the trigger input is high.
				The counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low.
				Both start and stop of the counter are controlled.
		- "trigger"   : The counter starts at a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not
				reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled.
		- "external_clock": Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter.
