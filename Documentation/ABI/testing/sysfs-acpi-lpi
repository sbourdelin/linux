What:		LPI sysfs interface for processor devices and containers

Description:	LPI(Low Power Idle) described in section 8.4.4 of ACPI spec 6.1
		provides different methods to obtain idle statistics maintained
		by the platform. These show a granular view of how each of the
		LPI state is being used at different level of processor hierarchy.
		sysfs data is exposed at each level in the hierarchy by creating
		a directory named 'lpi' at each level and the LPI state
		information is presented under it. Below is the representation
		of LPI information at one such level in the hierarchy.

		.../ACPI00XX: YY/lpi
			|-> state0
			|	|-> desc
			|	|-> time
			|	|-> usage
			|	|-> latency
			|	|-> min_residency
			|
			|-> state1
			|	|-> desc
			|	|-> time
			|	|-> usage
			|	|-> latency
			|	|-> min_residency
			|
			<<more states>>

		ACPI00XX can be ACPI0007(processor device) or ACPI0010(processor
		container) and the sysfs nodes for these ACPI devices can be
		found under /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00

		stateX contains information related to a specific local LPI
		state defined in the LPI ACPI tables under a owning hierarchy
		node(ACPI0007 or ACPI0010).

		desc	- Description/Name for the local LPI state
		latency - Worst case wake up latency(in micro seconds) for the
			owning hierarchy node to exit from this local idle state
		min_residency - Time in microseconds after which a state becomes
			more energy effecient than a shallower state
		time	- Total time spent(in micro seconds) by the owning
			hierarchy node in this local idle state
		usage	- Number of times the owning hierarchy node entered this
			local power state
