PCIe Device AER statistics
==========================
These attributes show up under all the devices that are AER capable. These
statistical counters indicate the errors "as seen/reported by the device".
Note that this may mean that if an end point is causing problems, the AER
counters may increment at its link partner (e.g. root port) because the
errors will be "seen" / reported by the link partner and not the the
problematic end point itself (which may report all counters as 0 as it never
saw any problems).

		by this PCI device using ERR_FATAL.

		by this PCI device using ERR_NONFATAL.

Where:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/aer_stats/dev_breakdown_correctable
Date:		May 2018
Kernel Version: 4.17.0
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, rajatja@google.com
Description:	Breakdown of correctable errors seen and reported by this
		PCI device using ERR_COR. Note that the sum total of all errors
		in dev_breakdown_correctable may exceed dev_total_cor_errs
		because a device is allowed to merge multiple correctable and
		send a single ERR_COR for them (which is what dev_total_cor_errs
		counts). A sample output for this attribute looks like this:
-----------------------------------------
Receiver Error = 174
Bad TLP = 19
Bad DLLP = 3
RELAY_NUM Rollover = 0
Replay Timer Timeout = 1
Advisory Non-Fatal = 0
Corrected Internal Error = 0
Header Log Overflow = 0
-----------------------------------------

Where:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<dev>/aer_stats/dev_breakdown_uncorrectable
Date:		May 2018
Kernel Version: 4.17.0
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org, rajatja@google.com
Description:	Breakdown of of correctable errors seen and reported by this
		PCI device using ERR_FATAL or ERR_NONFATAL. Note that the sum
		total of all errors in dev_breakdown_uncorrectable may exceed
		(dev_total_fatal_errs + dev_total_nonfatal_errs) because a
		device is allowed to merge multiple errors at the same severity
		and send a single ERR_FATAL/ERR_NON_FATAL for them.
		A sample output for this attribute looks like this:
-----------------------------------------
Undefined = 0
Data Link Protocol = 0
Surprise Down Error = 0
Poisoned TLP = 0
Flow Control Protocol = 0
Completion Timeout = 0
Completer Abort = 0
Unexpected Completion = 0
Receiver Overflow = 0
Malformed TLP = 0
ECRC = 0
Unsupported Request = 0
ACS Violation = 0
Uncorrectable Internal Error = 0
MC Blocked TLP = 0
AtomicOp Egress Blocked = 0
TLP Prefix Blocked Error = 0
-----------------------------------------

============================
PCIe Rootport AER statistics
============================
These attributes showup under only the rootports that are AER capable. These
indicate the number of error messages as "reported to" the rootport. Please note
that the rootports also transmit (internally) the ERR_* messages for errors seen
by the internal rootport PCI device, so these counters includes them and are
thus cumulative of all the error messages on the PCI hierarchy originating
at that root port.
