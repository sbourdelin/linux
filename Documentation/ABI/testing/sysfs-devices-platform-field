This document defines the sysfs attributes provided by the bmc-misc-ctrl
driver. See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/bmc-misc-ctrl.txt for
exhaustive list of field definitions.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/label
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		An RO attribute providing the name of the field of interest.
		Corresponds to the value of <label> in the path
Users:		openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/type
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		An RO attribute describing the type of the field. The type
		takes one of three values:

		'ro':	The field is read-only. The 'value' attribute will be
			read-only and neither 'set' nor 'clear' attributes will
			be present.
		'rw':	The field is read-write. The 'value' attribute will be
			both readable and writable and neither 'set' nor
			'clear' attributes will be present. Values written to
			the 'value' attribute will be atomically updated.
		'w1sc':	The field uses write-1-{set,clear} semantics. The
			'value' attribute will be read-only, and both 'set' and
			'clear' attributes will be present to manipulate
			'value'. 'set' and 'clear' will both be write-only.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/mask
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		An RO attribute providing the mask applied to the value
		read/written from the 'value' attribute.
Users:		openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/value
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		The value of the field of interest.

		If the field is exposed from a read-modify-write register this
		attribute will be RW, where writes will set the field to the
		value written. Writing values that exceed the width of the
		field will return an error.

		If the field is exposed from a write-1-set/write-1-clear
		register this attribute will be RO, and the attributes 'set'
		and 'clear' will be present as write-only.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/set
Users:		openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		A WO attribute that when written will set bits in the backing
		register corresponding to set bits in the value written.
		Register bits corresponding to cleared bits in the written
		value will remain unchanged.

		This attribute is exposed when the field is identified as being
		composed of write-1-set and write-1-clear registers.

		Writing values that exceed the width of the mask value will
		return an error.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/.../<field>/<label>/clear
Users:		openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		A WO attribute that when written will clear bits in the backing
		register corresponding to set bits in the value written.
		Register bits corresponding to cleared bits in the written
		value will remain unchanged.

		This attribute is exposed when the field is identified as being
		composed of write-1-set and write-1-clear registers.

		Writing values that exceed the width of the mask value will
		return an error.
