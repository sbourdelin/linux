Description:
	This read-only property describes the main type of source supply.
	Type-C is a USB standard so this property always returns "USB".

Description:
	This read-only property describes the type of source supply that is
	connected, if the supply is online. The value is always Type C
	unless a source has been attached which is identified as USB-PD capable.

	Valid values:
		- "USB_TYPE_C"	: Type C connected supply, not UBS-PD capable
				  (default value)
		- "USB_PD"	: USB-PD capable source supply connected
		- "USB_PD_PPS"	: USB-PD PPS capable source supply connected

Description:
	This read-write property describes the online state of the source
	supply. When the value of this property is not 0, and the supply allows
	it, then it's possible to switch between online states (i.e. 1 -> 2,
	2 -> 1)

	Valid values:
		- 0	: Offline, no source supply attached
		- 1	: Fixed Online, Type-C or USB-PD capable supply
			  attached, non-configurable current and voltage
			  properties in this state.
		- 2	: PPS Online, USB-PD PPS feature enabled, 'current_now'
			  and 'voltage_now' properties can be modified in this
			  state. Re-writing of this value again, once already
			  set, will re-request the same configured voltage and
			  current values. This can be used as a keep-alive for
			  the PPS connection.
			  [NOTE: This is value only selectable if
			   'connected_type' reports a value of "USB_PD_PPS"]

Description:
	This read-write property describes the voltage the source supply is
