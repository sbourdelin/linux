Description:	Sensor groups directory for POWER9 powernv servers

		Each folder in this directory contains a sensor group
		which are classified based on type of the sensor
		like power, temperature, frequency, current, etc. They
		can also indicate the group of sensors belonging to
		different owners like CSM, Profiler, Job-Scheduler

Description:	Sysfs file to clear the min-max of all the sensors
		belonging to the group.

		Writing 1 to this file will clear the minimum and
		maximum values of all the sensors in the group. The
		min-max of a sensor is the historical minimum and
		maximum value of the sensor cached by OCC.

What:		/sys/firmware/opal/sensor_groups/<sensor_group_name>/enable

Contact:	Linux for PowerPC mailing list <linuxppc-dev@ozlabs.org>
Description:	Sysfs file to enable/disable the sensor-group

		Writing 0 value to this file will disable the copying
		of the sensor-group to main memory by OCC. And writing
		1 to this file will enable the sensor-group copying.
		By default all the sensor-groups are enabled and will
		be copied to main memory. This file can be used to
		increase the update frequency of selective
		sensor-groups.
