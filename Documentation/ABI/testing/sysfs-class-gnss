Description:
		The GNSS device type. The currently identified types reflect
		the protocol(s) supported by the device:

			"NMEA"		NMEA 0183
			"SiRF"  	SiRF Binary
			"UBX"   	UBX

		Note that also non-"NMEA" type devices typically support a
		subset of NMEA 0183 with vendor extensions (e.g. to allow
		switching to a vendor protocol).
