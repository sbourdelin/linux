What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/color/sync_enable
Date:		January 2019
KernelVersion:	5.0
Contact:	Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>
Description:	read/write
		Writing a 1 to this file will enable the sychronization of all
		the defined color LEDs within the LED node.  Writing a 0 to
		this file will disable syncing.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/color/sync
Date:		January 2019
KernelVersion:	5.0
Contact:	Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>
Description:	write only
		Writing a 1 to this file while sync_enable is set to 1 will
		synchronize all defined LEDs within the LED node.  All LEDs
		defined will be configured based on the brightness that has
		been requested.

		If sync_enable is set to 0 then writing a 1 to sync has no
		affect on the LEDs.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/color/<led color>
Date:		January 2019
KernelVersion:	5.0
Contact:	Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>
Description:	read/write
		These files are dynamically created based on the colors defined
		by the registrar of the class.
		The led color(s) can be but not limited to red, green, blue,
		white, amber and violet.  If sync is enabled then writing the
		brightness value of the LED is deferred until a 1 is
		written to /sys/class/leds/<led>/color/sync.  If syncing is
		disabled then the LED brightness value will be written
		immediately to the LED driver.

		The value of the color is from 0 to
		/sys/class/leds/<led>/max_brightness.
