Description:	The /sys/consoles tree contains a directory for each console
		configured on the system. These directories contain the
		following attributes:

		* "loglevel"	Set the per-console loglevel: the kernel uses
				max(system_loglevel, perconsole_loglevel) when
				deciding whether to emit a given message. The
				default is 0, which means max() always yields
				the system setting in the kernel.printk sysctl.
