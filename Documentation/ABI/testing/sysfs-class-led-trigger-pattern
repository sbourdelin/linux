What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a software pattern for the LED, that supports altering
		the brightness for the specified duration with one software
		timer.

		The pattern is given by a series of tuples, of brightness and
		duration (ms). The LED is expected to traverse the series and
		each brightness value for the specified duration. Duration of
		0 means brightness should immediately change to new value.

		The format of the software pattern values should be:
		"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3
		duration_3 ...".

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/hw_pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a hardware pattern for the LED, for LED hardware that
		supports autonomously controlling brightness over time, according
		to some preprogrammed hardware patterns.

		Since different LED hardware can have different semantics of
		hardware patterns, each driver is expected to provide its own
		description for the hardware patterns in their ABI documentation
		file.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/repeat
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a pattern repeat number. -1 means repeat indefinitely,
		other negative numbers and number 0 are invalid.

		This file will always return the originally written repeat
		number.
