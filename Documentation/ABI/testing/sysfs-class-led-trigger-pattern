What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a software pattern for the LED, that supports altering
		the brightness for the specified duration with one software
		timer.

		The pattern is given by a series of tuples, of brightness and
		duration (ms). The LED is expected to traverse the series and
		each brightness value for the specified duration. Duration of
		0 means brightness should immediately change to new value.

		The format of the software pattern values should be:
		"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3
		duration_3 ...".

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/hw_pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a hardware pattern for the LED, for LED hardware that
		supports altering the brightness as a function of time.

		The pattern is given by a series of tuples, of brightness and
		duration (ms). The LED is expected to traverse the series and
		each brightness value for the specified duration. Duration of
		0 means brightness should immediately change to new value.

		The format of the hardware pattern values should be:
		"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3
		duration_3 ...".

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/repeat
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a pattern repeat number. 0 means repeat indefinitely.

		This file will always return the originally written repeat
		number.
