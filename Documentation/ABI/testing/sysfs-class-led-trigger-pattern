What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a software pattern for the LED, that supports altering
		the brightness for the specified duration with one software
		timer.

		The pattern is given by a series of tuples, of brightness and
		duration (ms). The LED is expected to traverse the series and
		each brightness value for the specified duration. Duration of
		0 means brightness should immediately change to new value.

		The format of the software pattern values should be:
		"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3
		duration_3 ...".

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/hw_pattern
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a hardware pattern for the LED, for LED hardware that
		supports autonomously controlling brightness over time, according
		to some preprogrammed hardware patterns.

		Since different LED hardware can have different semantics of
		hardware patterns, each driver is expected to provide its own
		description for the hardware patterns as below.

		For Spreadtrum SC27XX LED controller, it only supports 4 hardware
		patterns to configure the low time, rise time, high time and fall
		time for the breathing mode, and each stage duration unit is 125ms.
		So the format of the hardware pattern values should be:
		"brightness_1 duration_1 brightness_2 duration_2 brightness_3
		 duration_3 brightness_4 duration_4".

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/repeat
Date:		September 2018
KernelVersion:	4.20
Description:
		Specify a pattern repeat number. 0 means repeat indefinitely.

		This file will always return the originally written repeat
		number.
