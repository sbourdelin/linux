What:		/sys/class/bmc/<field>/label
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		The name of the field of interest. Corresponds to the value of
		<field> in the path
Users:		openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org

What:		/sys/class/bmc/<field>/value
Date:		July, 2018
KernelVersion:	v4.19
Contact:	openbmc@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:
		The value of the field of interest.

		If the field is exposed from a read-modify-write register this
		attribute will be RW, where writes will set the field to the
		value written. Writing values that exceed the width of the
		field will return an error.

		If the field is exposed from a write-1-set/write-1-clear
		register this attribute will be RO, and the attributes 'set'
		and 'clear' will be present as write-only.
