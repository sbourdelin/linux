What:		/sys/bus/nd/devices/nmemX/nfit/flags
Date:		Jun, 2015
KernelVersion:	v4.1
Contact:	linux-nvdimm@lists.01.org
Description:
		(RO) The flags in the NFIT memory device sub-structure indicate
		the state of the data on the nvdimm relative to its energy
		source or last "flush to persistence".

		The attribute is a translation of the 'NVDIMM State Flags' field
		in section 5.2.25.3 'NVDIMM Region Mapping' Structure of the
		ACPI specification 6.2.

		The health states are "save_fail", "restore_fail", "flush_fail",
		"not_armed", "smart_event", "map_fail" and "smart_notify".

What:		/sys/bus/nd/devices/nmemX/nfit/formats
Date:		Apr, 2016
KernelVersion:	v4.6
Contact:	linux-nvdimm@lists.01.org
Description:
		(RO) Identifiers for the programming interface. Starting with
		ACPI 6.1 an NFIT table reports multiple 'NVDIMM Control Region
		Structure' instances per-dimm, one for each supported format
		interface. That code is represented in the sysfs as follows:
		nmemX/nfit/formats, nmemX/nfit/format, nmemX/nfit/format1,
		nmemX/nfit/format2 ... nmemX/nfit/formatN, where format2 -
		formatN are theoretical as there are no known DIMMs with support
		for more than two interface formats. The 'formats' attribute
		displays the number of supported interfaces.

		This layout is compatible with existing libndctl binaries that
		only expect one code per-dimm as they will ignore
		nmemX/nfit/formats and nmemX/nfit/formatN.

Description:
		(RO) ACPI specification 6.2 section 5.2.25.9, defines an
		identifier for an NVDIMM, which refelects the id attribute.

		If the manufacturing location and manufacturing date fields are
		valid, then 'id' is composed of the vendor id (bytes 0-1),
		manufacturing location byte, manufacturing date (bytes 0-1) and
		the serial number(bytes 0-3), otherwise it is composed of vendor
		id (bytes 0-1) and serial number (bytes 0-3)

Description:
		(RW) This shows the number of full Address Range Scrubs (ARS)
		that have been completed since driver load time. Userspace can
		wait on this using select/poll etc. A '+' at the end indicates

Contact:	linux-nvdimm@lists.01.org
Description:
		(RW) Provides a way to toggle the behavior between just adding
		the address (cache line) where the MCE happened to the poison
		list and doing a full scrub. The former (selective insertion of
		the address) is done unconditionally.

		This attribute can have the following values written to it:

		'0': Switch to the default mode where an exception will only
		insert the address of the memory error into the poison and
		badblocks lists.
		'1': Enable a full scrub to happen if an exception for a memory
		error is received.
