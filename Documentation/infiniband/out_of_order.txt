Out of order data placement
===========================

This document describes out of order data placement feature and its
user interface.

1. Overview
===========

In certain fabric configurations IB packets for a given QP may take up
different paths in a network from source to destination. This results
into reaching packets out of order at the receiver side. Instead of
dropping packets, handling out of order packets can improve overall
network performance in following ways.
(a) improve network utilization by avoiding retransmission
(b) avoiding latency increase due to retransmission

2. Description
==============

This is optional feature of an HCA.
Enablement of this feature is done on per QP basis.
This optional QP attribute is set when a QP state is changed from INIT
to RTR.

Out of order data placement capability indicates that if HCA receives
out of order RDMA packets, their data placement can be done at the
desired memory destination given in the packet(s). This is applicable
to RDMA read and write operations.

Send queue work requests are still completed in-order regardless of
their data placement order at requester or responder side.

In-order semantics is always guaranteed by setting the Fence
indicator for appropriate WRs.

An application shall not depend on the contents of the RDMA write buffer
at the responder until one of the following occurred:
- Completion of the RDMA WRITE with immediate data receive completion.
- Arrival and completion of the subsequent SEND message.
- Update of a memory element by subsequent ATOMIC operation.

An application shall not depend on the contents of the RDMA read buffer
at the requester until one of the following occurred:
- Completion of the RDMA READ work request if requested or such
  work request completes with error status.
- Completion of the subsequent work request.

3. Usage
========

(a) ibv_query_device_ex returns out of order data placement
capability at ooo_caps structure for a given transport.
Whenever HCA supports such capability for each transport user
should get IB_OOO_RW_DATA_PLACEMENT set in the caps.

(b) When such capability is set, user can set
IB_QP_OOO_RW_DATA_PLACEMENT while invoking ibv_modify_qp().
IB_QP_OOO_RW_DATA_PLACEMENT is optional attribute which is supported
only when QP state transions from INIT to RTR state.
