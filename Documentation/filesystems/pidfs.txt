The PIDFS Filesystem
====================

The pidfs filesystem contains a subset of the /proc file system which contains
only information about the processes. The link self points to the process
reading the file system. All other special files and directories in /proc are
not available in this filesystem.

The pidfs is not an independent filesystem, its implementation shares code
with /proc.

All mount options applicable to /proc filesystem are also applicable
to pidfs filesystem. For example, access to the information in /proc/[pid]
directories can be restricted using hidepid option.

To get more information about the processes read the proc.txt
