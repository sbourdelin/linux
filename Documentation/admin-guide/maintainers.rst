List of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes
====================================================

Please try to follow the guidelines below.  This will make things
easier on the maintainers.  Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

Tips for patch submitters
-------------------------

1.	Always **test** your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
	5 people, preferably many more.

2.	Try to release a few ALPHA test versions to the net. Announce
	them onto the kernel channel and await results. This is especially
	important for device drivers, because often that's the only way
	you will find things like the fact version 3 firmware needs
	a magic fix you didn't know about, or some clown changed the
	chips on a board and not its name.  (Don't laugh!  Look at the
	SMC ``etherpower`` for that.)

3.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple
	configurations. In particular check that changes work both as a
	module and built into the kernel.

4.	When you are happy with a change make it generally available for
	testing and await feedback.

5.	Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list. Use
	``diff -u`` to make the patch easy to merge. Be prepared to get your
	changes sent back with seemingly silly requests about formatting
	and variable names.  These aren't as silly as they seem. One
	job the maintainers (and especially Linus) do is to keep things
	looking the same. Sometimes this means that the clever hack in
	your driver to get around a problem actually needs to become a
	generalized kernel feature ready for next time.

	.. attention::

	  **PLEASE:**

	  - check your patch with the automated style checker
	    (``scripts/checkpatch.pl``) to catch trivial style violations.
	    See :ref:`Documentation/process/coding-style.rst <codingstyle>`
	    for guidance here.

	  - CC: the maintainers and mailing lists that are generated
	    by ``scripts/get_maintainer.pl``.  The results returned by the
	    script will be best if you have git installed and are making
	    your changes in a branch derived from Linus' latest git tree.
	    See :ref:`Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst <submittingpatches>`
	    for details.

	  - try to include any credit lines you want added with the
	    patch. It avoids people being missed off by mistake and makes
	    it easier to know who wants adding and who doesn't.

	  - document known bugs. If it doesn't work for everything
	    or does something very odd once a month document it.

	  - remember that submissions must be made under the terms
	    of the Linux Foundation certificate of contribution and should
	    include a Signed-off-by: line.  The current version of this
	    "Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO) is listed in the file
	    :ref:`Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst <submittingpatches>`.

6.	Make sure you have the right to send any changes you make. If you
	do changes at work you may find your employer owns the patch
	not you.

7.	When sending security related changes or reports to a maintainer
	please Cc: security@kernel.org, especially if the maintainer
	does not respond.

8.	Happy hacking.

Descriptions of section entries
-------------------------------

- ``P:`` Person (obsolete)

- ``M:`` Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>

- ``R:`` Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>

	- These reviewers should be CCed on patches.

- ``L:`` Mailing list that is relevant to this area

- ``W:`` Web-page with status/info

- ``Q:`` Patchwork web based patch tracking system site

- ``T:`` SCM tree type and location.

	- Type is one of: **git**, **hg**, **quilt**, **stgit**, **topgit**

- ``S:`` Status, one of the following:

	   - **Supported**:
	     Someone is actually paid to look after this.

	   - **Maintained**:
	     Someone actually looks after it.

	   - **Odd Fixes**:
	     It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
	     much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..

	   - **Orphan**:
	     No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
	     role as you write your new code].

	   - **Obsolete**:
	     Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
	     it has been replaced by a better system and you
	     should be using that.

- ``F:`` Files and directories with wildcard patterns.

  A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.

  ===============================	================================
  ``F:``	``drivers/net/``	all files in and below
					``drivers/net``
  ``F:``	``drivers/net/*``	all files in ``drivers/net``,
					but not below
  ``F:``	``*/net/*``		all files in "any top level
					directory" ``/net``
  ===============================	================================

  One pattern per line.  Multiple ``F:`` lines acceptable.

- ``N:`` Files and directories with regex patterns.

  ============================	=============================================
  ``N:``			``[^a-z]tegra``	all files whose path contains
				the word ``tegra``
  ============================	=============================================

  One pattern per line.  Multiple ``N:`` lines acceptable.
  ``scripts/get_maintainer.pl`` has different behavior for files that
  match ``F:`` pattern and matches of ``N:`` patterns.  By default,
  ``scripts/get_maintainer.pl`` will not look at git log history when an ``F:``
  pattern match occurs.  When an ``N:`` match occurs, git log history
  is used to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.

- ``X:`` Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as ``F:``.

  Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
  Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:

  ============================	========================================
  ``F:``	``net/``	matches all files in and below
				``net`` ...
  ``X:``	``net/ipv6/``	... excluding ``net/ipv6/``
  ============================	========================================

- ``K:`` Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
  patch or file.

  For instance:

  =====================================	=====================================
  ``K:`` ``of_get_profile``		matches patches or files that contain
					``of_get_profile``
  ``K:`` ``\b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b``	matches patches or files that contain
					one or more of the words ``printk``,
					``pr_info`` or ``pr_err``
  =====================================	=====================================

  One regex pattern per line.  Multiple ``K:`` lines acceptable.

.. note::

  For the hard of thinking, this list is meant to remain in alphabetical
  order. If you could add yourselves to it in alphabetical order that would be
  so much easier [Ed]
