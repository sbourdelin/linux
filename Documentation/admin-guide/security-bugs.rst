Security bugs
=============

Linux kernel developers take security very seriously.  As such, we'd
like to know when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and
disclosed as quickly as possible.  Please report security bugs to the
Linux kernel security team.

Contact
-------

The Linux kernel security team can be contacted by email at
<security@kernel.org>.  This is a private list of security officers
who will help verify the bug report and develop and release a fix.
If you already have a fix, please include it with your report, as
that can speed up the process considerably.  It is possible that the
security team will bring in extra help from area maintainers to
understand and fix the security vulnerability.

As it is with any bug, the more information provided the easier it
will be to diagnose and fix.  Please review the procedure outlined in
admin-guide/reporting-bugs.rst if you are unclear about what
information is helpful.  Any exploit code is very helpful and will not
be released without consent from the reporter unless it has already been
made public.

Analysis
--------

Sometimes a bug will be very well understood by some of the security
officers who will propose you a patch to test.  Please get prepared to
receiving extra questions and to provide answers on a timely basis.
There is little chance a bug will get fixed if you send an incomplete
report and disappear for two weeks.  It is also possible that some of
the officers will conclude that the behaviour you observed is normal
and expected, that it is bogus but doesn't present an imminent
security risk and should rather be discussed on public lists, or that
it does indeed represent a risk, but that the risk of breakage induced
by fixing it outweights the risks of the bug being exploited.  In such
situations, it is possible that you will be requested to post your
report to another more suitable place.

Analysing a report takes a lot of time, and while sometimes it's
better to conclude to a wrong alert because there is nothing to fix,
it also is annoying if it is discovered that the reporter should have
found it by himself, because the time lost on this analysis was not
spent on another one.  This can happen all the time to be wrong about
a report, but please be careful not to do this too often or your
reports may not be taken seriously in the end.

As a rule of thumb, it is recommended not to post messages suggesting
that a bug may exist somewhere.  Since the security team manages
imminent and important risks, bugs reported there must be based on
facts and not on beliefs.  It is fine to report a panic message saying
"I just got this, I don't know how it happened but it scares me", it is
not fine to say "I ran my new automated analysis tool which thinks a
check is missing here, could someone knowledgeable in this area please
double-check".  The security team's role is not to have opinions on
your beliefs but to spot the right people to help fix a real problem.

Very often, some maintainers will be brought to the discussion as the
analysis progresses. Most of the time these people will not have received
the initial e-mail, and they're discovering the issue late.  So please do
not get upset if they ask questions that were already addressed or which
were present in the initial report.

Also, don't consider the bug fixed until the fix is merged.  It can
happen that a fix proposed by one of the security officers doesn't suit
a subsystem maintainer and that it has to be reworked differently,
possibly after a public discussion.

Disclosure
----------

The goal of the Linux kernel security team is to work with the bug
submitter to understand and fix the bug.  We prefer to publish the fix as
soon as possible, but try to avoid public discussion of the bug itself
and leave that to others.

Publishing the fix may be delayed when the bug or the fix is not yet
fully understood, the solution is not well-tested or for vendor
coordination.  However, we expect these delays to be short, measurable in
days, not weeks or months.  A release date is negotiated by the security
team working with the bug submitter as well as vendors.  However, the
kernel security team holds the final say when setting a timeframe.  The
timeframe varies from immediate (esp. if it's already publicly known bug)
to a few weeks.  As a basic default policy, we expect report date to
release date to be on the order of 7 days.

There is no point threatening to make a report public after XX days
without a response because usually what you will end up with is a fix
that is merged much earlier than what you possibly expected, for example
if you promised to someone not to publish it before a certain date.
Please just understand that the security team's goal is for your bug to
be fixed as fast as possible and not to sleep on it.

If you report a particularly complex issue that you intend to discuss
at a conference a few weeks or months later, you cannot really expect
from the security team to find a solution in time and at the same time
to refrain from disclosing the issue to a broader audience or
releasing the fix.  So at the very least you will have to take your
dispositions to deal with a disclosure which happens much earlier than
your public talk about the issue.  Also if you only sent an early
notification about a forthcoming problem that is not yet fully
disclosed, you must not expect the security officers to ping you again
later about the issue; you are responsible for reloading the
discussion at the right moment once all elements are gathered.

Coordination
------------

Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
<linux-distros@vs.openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>

Crediting the reporter
----------------------

The security team has a great respect for reporters' work and wants to
encourage high-quality reports that help fix real issues.  As such, the
reporter will usually be asked who must be credited for reporting the
bug before writing the final patch.  It is often not well perceived to
send a report and start by explaining whom to credit for the report, as
experience shows that people who focus a bit too much on being properly
credited when they don't know yet if what they found is a valid bug tend
not to provide the highest quality reports nor to interact the best with
the team.  So the best way to be properly credited is to provide a patch
with an appropriate commit message along with the analysis.  The second
best way is to stay humble and participate with the rest of the team to
the bug fixing session.  It will bring you a lot of respect and will help
your future reports get more attention.

CVE assignment
--------------

The security team does not normally assign CVEs, nor do we require them
for reports or fixes, as this can needlessly complicate the process and
may delay the bug handling. If a reporter wishes to have a CVE identifier
assigned ahead of public disclosure, they will need to contact the private
linux-distros list, described above. When such a CVE identifier is known
before a patch is provided, it is desirable to mention it in the commit
message, though.

Non-disclosure agreements
-------------------------

The Linux kernel security team is not a formal body and therefore unable
to enter any non-disclosure agreements.
