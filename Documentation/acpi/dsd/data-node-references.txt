Referencing hierarchical data nodes
-----------------------------------

ACPI in general allows referring to device objects in the tree only.
Hierarchical data extension nodes may not be referred to directly, hence this
document defines a scheme to implement such references.

The references consist of the device node followed by the first package entries
of the hierarchical data node extensions from the first child node of the device
node until the referred data extension node.

The first package list entry in the hierarchical data node shall consist of the
name of the node, "@" character and the number of the node. If the node has no
numerical value, then the number shall be omitted. The first package list
entries of the hierarchical data nodes shall be unique directly under the parent
of the node, i.e. there may not be two hierarchical data extensions that have
the same first package entry under any node (device or hierarchical data
extension).

Please see a graph example in graph.txt .
