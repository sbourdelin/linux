ACPI device properties are exported via sysfs under
<device>/firmware_node/properties/*.  This is a logical extension of
the changes that expose _ADR, _STR, _HID, etc... in the same
directory.

Integer properties are represented by a file containing a single hex
number (printf format 0x%llx).

String properties are represented by a file containing a single
string.

Arrays of integers properties are represented by a file containing a
space delimited string of hex numbers (printf format 0x%llx).

Example:
  0x1 0x2 0x3

Arrays of strings properties are represented by a file containing a
newline delimited string of escaped strings (printf format %*pE).

Example:
  foo
  bar
  has\nnewline

Device reference properties are represented by a symlink to the
referenced device plus a <property>_args node containing an integer
array of reference arguments.  In the case of multiple local
references, the references at index 1..N are represented the same way
using the naming convention <property><N>, <property><N>_args.

Examples:
  (a property containing a single reference)

  phy-handle -> ../../../device:00
  phy-handle_args: 0x0

  (a property containing three references)

  ref -> ../device:01
  ref_args: 0x1 0x2
  ref1 -> ../device:02
  ref1_args: 0x3 0x4
  ref2 -> ../device:03
  ref2_args: 0x5 0x6
