Linux KVM Coalesced PIO:
========================
Coalesced pio is base on coalesced mmio. When the write access to a port
of a device does a simple work or can delay, then follows a access to the
same device, it can use coalesced pio optimizing method.

using coalesced pio, the write access to port A of a device do not exit
to userspace, and just record the value in shared coalesced ring in kernel.
Then following access to the port B of the same device or read access to
the port A will get the previous write value of port A firstly in usersapce
according to the shared coalesced ring.

Now just use coalesced pio for rtc 0x70 port and we can find other ports
in the future.

for example: rtc port 0x70
without coalesced pio:
  guest write port 0x70
    vm_exit to userspace
      userspace set register index: regindex
    vm_entry
  guest read or write 0x71
    vm_exit to userspace
      usersapce get/set rtc regisers[regindex]
    vm_entry

with coalesced pio:
  guest write port 0x70
    vm_exit to kernel
    vm_entry
  guest read or write 0x71
    vm_exit to userspace
      usersapce set register index: regindex
      usersapce get/set rtc regisers[regindex]
    vm_entry
