Coalesced MMIO and coalesced PIO can be used to optimize writes to
simple device registers. Writes to a coalesced-I/O region are not
reported to userspace until the next non-coalesced I/O is issued,
in a similar fashion to write combining hardware.  In KVM, coalesced
writes are handled in the kernel without exits to userspace, and
are thus several times faster.

Examples of devices that can benefit from coalesced I/O include:

- devices whose memory is accessed with many consecutive writes, for
  example the EGA/VGA video RAM.

- windows I/O, such as the real-time clock. The address register (port
  0x70 in the RTC case) can use coalesced I/O, cutting the number of
  userspace exits by half when reading or writing the RTC.
