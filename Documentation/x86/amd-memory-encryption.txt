Secure Memory Encryption (SME) is a feature found on AMD processors.

SME provides the ability to mark individual pages of memory as encrypted using
the standard x86 page tables.  A page that is marked encrypted will be
automatically decrypted when read from DRAM and encrypted when written to
DRAM.  SME can therefore be used to protect the contents of DRAM from physical
attacks on the system.

A page is encrypted when a page table entry has the encryption bit set (see
below how to determine the position of the bit).  The encryption bit can be
specified in the cr3 register, allowing the PGD table to be encrypted. Each
successive level of page tables can also be encrypted.

Support for SME can be determined through the CPUID instruction. The CPUID
function 0x8000001f reports information related to SME:

	0x8000001f[eax]:
		Bit[0] indicates support for SME
	0x8000001f[ebx]:
		Bit[5:0]  pagetable bit number used to enable memory encryption
		Bit[11:6] reduction in physical address space, in bits, when
			  memory encryption is enabled (this only affects system
			  physical addresses, not guest physical addresses)

If support for SME is present, MSR 0xc00100010 (SYS_CFG) can be used to
determine if SME is enabled and/or to enable memory encryption:

	0xc0010010:
		Bit[23]   0 = memory encryption features are disabled
			  1 = memory encryption features are enabled

Linux relies on BIOS to set this bit if BIOS has determined that the reduction
in the physical address space as a result of enabling memory encryption (see
CPUID information above) will not conflict with the address space resource
requirements for the system.  If this bit is not set upon Linux startup then
Linux itself will not set it and memory encryption will not be possible.

SME support is configurable through the AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT config option.
Additionally, the mem_encrypt=on command line parameter is required to activate
memory encryption.
