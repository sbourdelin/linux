Identifying Your Adapter
------------------------
The driver in this release is compatible with devices based on the Intel(R)
Ethernet Multi-host Controller.

For information on how to identify your adapter, and for the latest Intel
network drivers, refer to the Intel Support website:
http://www.intel.com/support


Flow Control
------------
The Intel(R) Ethernet Switch Host Interface Driver does not support Flow
Control. It will not send pause frames. This may result in dropped frames.


Intel(R) Ethernet Flow Director
-------------------------------
The Intel Ethernet Flow Director performs the following tasks:

- Directs receive packets according to their flows to different queues.
- Enables tight control on routing a flow in the platform.
- Matches flows and CPU cores for flow affinity.
- Supports multiple parameters for flexible flow classification and load
  balancing (in SFP mode only).

NOTE: An included script (set_irq_affinity) automates setting the IRQ to CPU
affinity.

ethtool commands:

To enable or disable the Intel Ethernet Flow Director:

  # ethtool -K ethX ntuple <on|off>

When disabling ntuple filters, all the user programmed filters are flushed from
the driver cache and hardware. All needed filters must be re-added when ntuple
is re-enabled.

To add a filter that directs packet to queue 2, use -U or -N switch:

  # ethtool -N ethX flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.168.10.1 dst-ip \
  192.168.10.2 src-port 2000 dst-port 2001 action 2 [loc 1]

To see the list of filters currently present:
  # ethtool <-u|-n> ethX


max_vfs
-------
This parameter adds support for SR-IOV. It causes the driver to spawn up to
max_vfs worth of virtual functions.
Valid Range:0-64

NOTE: This parameter is only used on kernel 3.7.x and below. On kernel 3.8.x
and above, use sysfs to enable VFs. Also, for Red Hat distributions, this
parameter is only used on version 6.6 and older. For version 6.7 and newer, use
sysfs. For example:
#echo $num_vf_enabled > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//enable
VFs
#echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//disable VFs

The parameters for the driver are referenced by position. Thus, if you have a
dual port adapter, or more than one adapter in your system, and want N virtual
functions per port, you must specify a number for each port with each parameter
separated by a comma. For example:

  modprobe fm10k max_vfs=4

This will spawn 4 VFs on the first port.

  modprobe fm10k max_vfs=2,4

This will spawn 2 VFs on the first port and 4 VFs on the second port.

NOTE: Caution must be used in loading the driver with these parameters.
Depending on your system configuration, number of slots, etc., it is impossible
to predict in all cases where the positions would be on the command line.

NOTE: Neither the device nor the driver control how VFs are mapped into config
space. Bus layout will vary by operating system. On operating systems that
support it, you can check sysfs to find the mapping.

NOTE: When SR-IOV mode is enabled, hardware VLAN filtering and VLAN tag
stripping/insertion will remain enabled. Please remove the old VLAN filter
before the new VLAN filter is added. For example,
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 100	// set vlan 100 for VF 0
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 0	// Delete vlan 100
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 200	// set a new vlan 200 for VF 0


Additional Features and Configurations
-------------------------------------------

Jumbo Frames
------------
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the
following where <x> is the interface number:

   ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up
Alternatively, you can use the ip command as follows:
   ip link set mtu 9000 dev eth<x>
   ip link set up dev eth<x>

This setting is not saved across reboots. The setting change can be made
permanent by adding 'MTU=9000' to the file:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth<x> for RHEL or to the file
/etc/sysconfig/network/<config_file> for SLES.

NOTE: The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 15342. This value coincides
with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 15364 bytes.

NOTE: This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive
each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues when
allocating receive packets.


Generic Receive Offload, aka GRO
--------------------------------
The driver supports the in-kernel software implementation of GRO. GRO has
shown that by coalescing Rx traffic into larger chunks of data, CPU
utilization can be significantly reduced when under large Rx load. GRO is an
evolution of the previously-used LRO interface. GRO is able to coalesce
other protocols besides TCP. It's also safe to use with configurations that
are problematic for LRO, namely bridging and iSCSI.


ethtool
-------
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest ethtool
version is required for this functionality. Download it at:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/

Supported ethtool Commands and Options for Filtering
----------------------------------------------------
-n --show-nfc
  Retrieves the receive network flow classification configurations.

rx-flow-hash tcp4|udp4|ah4|esp4|sctp4|tcp6|udp6|ah6|esp6|sctp6
  Retrieves the hash options for the specified network traffic type.

-N --config-nfc
  Configures the receive network flow classification.

rx-flow-hash tcp4|udp4|ah4|esp4|sctp4|tcp6|udp6|ah6|esp6|sctp6
m|v|t|s|d|f|n|r...
  Configures the hash options for the specified network traffic type.

  udp4 UDP over IPv4
  udp6 UDP over IPv6

  f Hash on bytes 0 and 1 of the Layer 4 header of the rx packet.
  n Hash on bytes 2 and 3 of the Layer 4 header of the rx packet.


FCoE
----
The fm10k driver supports Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Data Center
Bridging (DCB). This code has no default effect on the regular driver
operation. Configuring DCB and FCoE is outside the scope of this README. Refer
to http://www.open-fcoe.org/ for FCoE project information and contact
fm10k-eedc@lists.sourceforge.net for DCB information.


MAC and VLAN anti-spoofing feature
----------------------------------
When a malicious driver attempts to send a spoofed packet, it is dropped by the
hardware and not transmitted.

An interrupt is sent to the PF driver notifying it of the spoof attempt. When a
spoofed packet is detected, the PF driver will send the following message to
the system log (displayed by the "dmesg" command):
NOTE: This feature can be disabled for a specific Virtual Function (VF):
ip link set <pf dev> vf <vf id> spoofchk {off|on}


Known Issues/Troubleshooting
----------------------------

Enabling SR-IOV in a 64-bit Microsoft* Windows Server* 2012/R2 guest OS under
Linux KVM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KVM Hypervisor/VMM supports direct assignment of a PCIe device to a VM. This
includes traditional PCIe devices, as well as SR-IOV-capable devices based on
the Intel Ethernet Controller XL710.
