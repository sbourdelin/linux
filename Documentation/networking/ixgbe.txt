SFP+ Devices with Pluggable Optics
----------------------------------

82599-BASED ADAPTERS
--------------------

NOTES:
- If your 82599-based Intel(R) Network Adapter came with Intel optics or is an
  Intel(R) Ethernet Server Adapter X520-2, then it only supports Intel optics
  and/or the direct attach cables listed below.
- When 82599-based SFP+ devices are connected back to back, they should be
  set to the same Speed setting via ethtool. Results may vary if you mix
  speed settings.

Laser turns off for SFP+ when ifconfig ethX down
------------------------------------------------

"ifconfig ethX down" turns off the laser for 82599-based SFP+ fiber adapters.
"ifconfig ethX up" turns on the laser.
Alternatively, you can use "ip link set [down/up] dev ethX" to turn the
laser off and on.


82599-based QSFP+ Adapters
--------------------------

NOTES:
- If your 82599-based Intel(R) Network Adapter came with Intel optics, it
  only supports Intel optics.
- 82599-based QSFP+ adapters only support 4x10 Gbps connections.
  1x40 Gbps connections are not supported. QSFP+ link partners must be
  configured for 4x10 Gbps.
- 82599-based QSFP+ adapters do not support automatic link speed detection.
  The link speed must be configured to either 10 Gbps or 1 Gbps to match the
  link partners speed capabilities. Incorrect speed configurations will result
  in failure to link.
- Intel(R) Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X520-Q1 only supports the
  optics and direct attach cables listed below.

Flow Control
------------
Ethernet Flow Control (IEEE 802.3x) can be configured with ethtool to enable
receiving and transmitting pause frames for ixgbe. When transmit is enabled,
pause frames are generated when the receive packet buffer crosses a predefined
threshold. When receive is enabled, the transmit unit will halt for the time
delay specified when a pause frame is received.

NOTE: You must have a flow control capable link partner.

Flow Control is enabled by default.

Use ethtool to change the flow control settings.

To enable or disable rx or tx Flow Control:
ethtool -A eth? rx <on|off> tx <on|off>
Note: This command only enables or disables Flow Control if auto-negotiation is
disabled. If auto-negotiation is enabled, this command changes the parameters
used for auto-negotiation with the link partner.

To enable or disable auto-negotiation:
ethtool -s eth? autoneg <on|off>
Note: Flow Control auto-negotiation is part of link auto-negotiation. Depending
on your device, you may not be able to change the auto-negotiation setting.

NOTE: For 82598 backplane cards entering 1 gigabit mode, flow control default
behavior is changed to off. Flow control in 1 gigabit mode on these devices can
lead to transmit hangs.


Intel(R) Ethernet Flow Director
-------------------------------
The Intel Ethernet Flow Director performs the following tasks:

- Directs receive packets according to their flows to different queues.
- Enables tight control on routing a flow in the platform.
- Matches flows and CPU cores for flow affinity.
- Supports multiple parameters for flexible flow classification and load
  balancing (in SFP mode only).

NOTE: An included script (set_irq_affinity) automates setting the IRQ to CPU
affinity.

NOTE: Intel Ethernet Flow Director masking works in the opposite manner from
subnet masking. In the following command:
  #ethtool -N eth11 flow-type ip4 src-ip 172.4.1.2 m 255.0.0.0 dst-ip \
  172.21.1.1 m 255.128.0.0 action 31
The src-ip value that is written to the filter will be 0.4.1.2, not 172.0.0.0
as might be expected. Similarly, the dst-ip value written to the filter will be
0.21.1.1, not 172.0.0.0.

ethtool commands:

To enable or disable the Intel Ethernet Flow Director:

  # ethtool -K ethX ntuple <on|off>

When disabling ntuple filters, all the user programmed filters are flushed from
the driver cache and hardware. All needed filters must be re-added when ntuple
is re-enabled.

To add a filter that directs packet to queue 2, use -U or -N switch:

  # ethtool -N ethX flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.168.10.1 dst-ip \
  192.168.10.2 src-port 2000 dst-port 2001 action 2 [loc 1]

To see the list of filters currently present:
  # ethtool <-u|-n> ethX


Sideband Perfect Filters
------------------------
Sideband Perfect Filters are used to direct traffic that matches specified
characteristics. They are enabled through ethtool's ntuple interface. To add a
new filter use the following command:
  ethtool -U <device> flow-type <type> src-ip <ip> dst-ip <ip> src-port <port>
dst-port <port> action <queue>
Where:
  <device> - the ethernet device to program
  <type> - can be ip4, tcp4, udp4, or sctp4
  <ip> - the ip address to match on
  <port> - the port number to match on
  <queue> - the queue to direct traffic towards (-1 discards the matched
traffic)
Use the following command to display all of the active filters:
  ethtool -u <device>
Use the following command to delete a filter:
  ethtool -U <device> delete <N>
Where <N> is the filter id displayed when printing all the active filters, and
may also have been specified using "loc <N>" when adding the filter.

The following example matches TCP traffic sent from 192.168.0.1, port 5300,
directed to 192.168.0.5, port 80, and sends it to queue 7:
  ethtool -U enp130s0 flow-type tcp4 src-ip 192.168.0.1 dst-ip 192.168.0.5
  src-port 5300 dst-port 7 action 7

For each flow-type, the programmed filters must all have the same matching
input set. For example, issuing the following two commands is acceptable:
  ethtool -U enp130s0 flow-type ip4 src-ip 192.168.0.1 src-port 5300 action 7
  ethtool -U enp130s0 flow-type ip4 src-ip 192.168.0.5 src-port 55 action 10
Issuing the next two commands, however, is not acceptable, since the first
specifies src-ip and the second specifies dst-ip:
  ethtool -U enp130s0 flow-type ip4 src-ip 192.168.0.1 src-port 5300 action 7
  ethtool -U enp130s0 flow-type ip4 dst-ip 192.168.0.5 src-port 55 action 10
The second command will fail with an error. You may program multiple filters
with the same fields, using different values, but, on one device, you may not
program two tcp4 filters with different matching fields.

Matching on a sub-portion of a field is not supported by the ixgbe driver, thus
partial mask fields are not supported.

The driver also supports matching user-defined data within the packet payload.
This flexible data is specified using the "user-def" field of the ethtool
command in the following way:
+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| 31    28    24    20    16 | 15    12    8    4    0  |
+----------------------------+--------------------------+
| offset into packet payload | 2 bytes of flexible data |
+----------------------------+--------------------------+

For example,
  ... user-def 0x4FFFF ...

tells the filter to look 4 bytes into the payload and match that value against
0xFFFF. The offset is based on the beginning of the payload, and not the
beginning of the packet. Thus

  flow-type tcp4 ... user-def 0x8BEAF ...

would match TCP/IPv4 packets which have the value 0xBEAF 8 bytes into the
TCP/IPv4 payload.

Note that ICMP headers are parsed as 4 bytes of header and 4 bytes of payload.
Thus to match the first byte of the payload, you must actually add 4 bytes to
the offset. Also note that ip4 filters match both ICMP frames as well as raw
(unknown) ip4 frames, where the payload will be the L3 payload of the IP4 frame.

The maximum offset is 64. The hardware will only read up to 64 bytes of data
from the payload. The offset must be even because the flexible data is 2 bytes
long and must be aligned to byte 0 of the packet payload.

The user-defined flexible offset is also considered part of the input set and
cannot be programmed separately for multiple filters of the same type. However,
the flexible data is not part of the input set and multiple filters may use the
same offset but match against different data.

To create filters that direct traffic to a specific Virtual Function, use the
"action" parameter. Specify the action as a 64 bit value, where the lower 32
bits represents the queue number, while the next 8 bits represent which VF.
Note that 0 is the PF, so the VF identifier is offset by 1. For example:

  ... action 0x800000002 ...

specifies to direct traffic to Virtual Function 7 (8 minus 1) into queue 2 of
that VF.

Note that these filters will not break internal routing rules, and will not
route traffic that otherwise would not have been sent to the specified Virtual
Function.


FdirPballoc
-----------
Valid Range: 1-3
Specifies the Flow Director allocated packet buffer size.
1 = 64k
2 = 128k
3 = 256k


AtrSampleRate
-------------
Valid Range: 0-255
This parameter is used with the Flow Director and is the software ATR transmit
packet sample rate. For example, when AtrSampleRate is set to 20, every 20th
packet looks to see if the packet will create a new flow. A value of 0
indicates that ATR should be disabled and no samples will be taken.


Node
----
Valid Range: 0-n
0 - n: where n is the number of the NUMA node that should be used to allocate
memory for this adapter port.
-1: uses the driver default of allocating memory on whichever processor is
running modprobe.
The Node parameter allows you to choose which NUMA node you want to have the
adapter allocate memory from. All driver structures, in-memory queues, and
receive buffers will be allocated on the node specified. This parameter is
only useful when interrupt affinity is specified; otherwise, part of the
interrupt time could run on a different core than where the memory is
allocated causing slower memory access and impacting throughput, CPU, or both.


max_vfs
-------
This parameter adds support for SR-IOV. It causes the driver to spawn up to
max_vfs worth of virtual functions.
Valid Range: 1-63
If the value is greater than 0 it will also force the VMDq parameter to be 1 or
more.

NOTE: This parameter is only used on kernel 3.7.x and below. On kernel 3.8.x
and above, use sysfs to enable VFs. Also, for Red Hat distributions, this
parameter is only used on version 6.6 and older. For version 6.7 and newer, use
sysfs. For example:
#echo $num_vf_enabled > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//enable
VFs
#echo 0 > /sys/class/net/$dev/device/sriov_numvfs	//disable VFs

The parameters for the driver are referenced by position. Thus, if you have a
dual port adapter, or more than one adapter in your system, and want N virtual
functions per port, you must specify a number for each port with each parameter
separated by a comma. For example:

  modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=4

This will spawn 4 VFs on the first port.

  modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=2,4

This will spawn 2 VFs on the first port and 4 VFs on the second port.

NOTE: Caution must be used in loading the driver with these parameters.
Depending on your system configuration, number of slots, etc., it is impossible
to predict in all cases where the positions would be on the command line.

NOTE: Neither the device nor the driver control how VFs are mapped into config
space. Bus layout will vary by operating system. On operating systems that
support it, you can check sysfs to find the mapping.

NOTE: When either SR-IOV mode or VMDq mode is enabled, hardware VLAN filtering
and VLAN tag stripping/insertion will remain enabled. Please remove the old
VLAN filter before the new VLAN filter is added. For example,
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 100	// set vlan 100 for VF 0
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 0	// Delete vlan 100
ip link set eth0 vf 0 vlan 200	// set a new vlan 200 for VF 0

With kernel 3.6, the driver supports the simultaneous usage of max_vfs and DCB
features, subject to the constraints described below. Prior to kernel 3.6, the
driver did not support the simultaneous operation of max_vfs greater than 0 and
the DCB features (multiple traffic classes utilizing Priority Flow Control and
Extended Transmission Selection).

When DCB is enabled, network traffic is transmitted and received through
multiple traffic classes (packet buffers in the NIC). The traffic is associated
with a specific class based on priority, which has a value of 0 through 7 used
in the VLAN tag. When SR-IOV is not enabled, each traffic class is associated
with a set of receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. The number of queue
pairs for a given traffic class depends on the hardware configuration. When
SR-IOV is enabled, the descriptor queue pairs are grouped into pools. The
Physical Function (PF) and each Virtual Function (VF) is allocated a pool of
receive/transmit descriptor queue pairs. When multiple traffic classes are
configured (for example, DCB is enabled), each pool contains a queue pair from
each traffic class. When a single traffic class is configured in the hardware,
the pools contain multiple queue pairs from the single traffic class.

The number of VFs that can be allocated depends on the number of traffic
classes that can be enabled. The configurable number of traffic classes for
each enabled VF is as follows:
0 - 15 VFs = Up to 8 traffic classes, depending on device support
16 - 31 VFs = Up to 4 traffic classes
32 - 63 VFs = 1 traffic class

When VFs are configured, the PF is allocated one pool as well. The PF supports
the DCB features with the constraint that each traffic class will only use a
single queue pair. When zero VFs are configured, the PF can support multiple
queue pairs per traffic class.


Additional Features and Configurations
-------------------------------------------

Jumbo Frames
------------
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the
following where <x> is the interface number:

   ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up
Alternatively, you can use the ip command as follows:
   ip link set mtu 9000 dev eth<x>
   ip link set up dev eth<x>

This setting is not saved across reboots. The setting change can be made
permanent by adding 'MTU=9000' to the file:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth<x> for RHEL or to the file
/etc/sysconfig/network/<config_file> for SLES.

NOTE: The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9710. This value coincides
with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 9728 bytes.

NOTE: This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive
each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues when
allocating receive packets.

NOTE: For 82599-based network connections, if you are enabling jumbo frames in
a virtual function (VF), jumbo frames must first be enabled in the physical
function (PF). The VF MTU setting cannot be larger than the PF MTU.


Generic Receive Offload, aka GRO
--------------------------------
The driver supports the in-kernel software implementation of GRO. GRO has
shown that by coalescing Rx traffic into larger chunks of data, CPU
utilization can be significantly reduced when under large Rx load. GRO is an
evolution of the previously-used LRO interface. GRO is able to coalesce
other protocols besides TCP. It's also safe to use with configurations that
are problematic for LRO, namely bridging and iSCSI.


Data Center Bridging (DCB)
--------------------------
NOTE:
The kernel assumes that TC0 is available, and will disable Priority Flow
Control (PFC) on the device if TC0 is not available. To fix this, ensure TC0 is
enabled when setting up DCB on your switch.


DCB is a configuration Quality of Service implementation in hardware. It uses
the VLAN priority tag (802.1p) to filter traffic. That means that there are 8
different priorities that traffic can be filtered into. It also enables
priority flow control (802.1Qbb) which can limit or eliminate the number of
dropped packets during network stress. Bandwidth can be allocated to each of
these priorities, which is enforced at the hardware level (802.1Qaz).

Adapter firmware implements LLDP and DCBX protocol agents as per 802.1AB and
802.1Qaz respectively. The firmware based DCBX agent runs in willing mode only
and can accept settings from a DCBX capable peer. Software configuration of
DCBX parameters via dcbtool/lldptool are not supported.

The ixgbe driver implements the DCB netlink interface layer to allow user-space
to communicate with the driver and query DCB configuration for the port.


ethtool
-------
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest ethtool
version is required for this functionality. Download it at:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/


FCoE
----
The ixgbe driver supports Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Data Center
Bridging (DCB). This code has no default effect on the regular driver
operation. Configuring DCB and FCoE is outside the scope of this README. Refer
to http://www.open-fcoe.org/ for FCoE project information and contact
ixgbe-eedc@lists.sourceforge.net for DCB information.


MAC and VLAN anti-spoofing feature
----------------------------------
When a malicious driver attempts to send a spoofed packet, it is dropped by the
hardware and not transmitted.

An interrupt is sent to the PF driver notifying it of the spoof attempt. When a
spoofed packet is detected, the PF driver will send the following message to
the system log (displayed by the "dmesg" command):
ixgbe ethX: ixgbe_spoof_check: n spoofed packets detected
where "x" is the PF interface number; and "n" is number of spoofed packets.
NOTE: This feature can be disabled for a specific Virtual Function (VF):
ip link set <pf dev> vf <vf id> spoofchk {off|on}
