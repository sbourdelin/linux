This virtual function driver supports kernel versions 2.6.x and newer.

This driver supports Intel 82576-based virtual function devices-based virtual
function devices
that can only be activated on kernels that support SR-IOV.

SR-IOV requires the correct platform and OS support.

The guest OS loading this driver must support MSI-X interrupts.

This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not
supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the
drivers.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to use
with Linux.

Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ifconfig.
Instructions on updating ethtool can be found in the section Additional
Configurations later in this document.

VLANs: There is a limit of a total of 32 shared VLANs to 1 or more VFs.
